**We follow the flow of methodology section (Section 3) to explain our implementation.**

## 1. Concept-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) Generation
### 1.1 LLM-based KG extraction via prompting
The jupyter notebook to prompt KG for EHR medical code:

``` bash
/graphcare_/graph_generation/graph_gen.ipynb
```
We place sample KGs generated by GPT-4 as 
``` bash
/graphs/{condition/CCSCM,procedure/CCSPROC,drug/ATC3}/{code_id}.txt
```

### 1.2 Subgraph sampling from existing KGs
The script for subgraph sampling from UMLS:
``` bash
/KG_mapping/umls_sampling.py
```
We place 2-hop sample KGs randomly subsampled from UMLS as 
``` bash
/graphs/umls_2hop.csv
```

### 1.3 Word Embedding Retrieval for Nodes & Edges
The jupyter notebooks for word embedding retrieval:
``` bash
/graphcare_/graph_generation/{cond,proc,drug}_emb_ret.ipynb
```
Due to the large size of word embedding, we do not include them in the repo. You can use our script to retrieve it and store it in either 
``` bash
/graphs/cond_proc/{entity_embedding.pkl, relation_embedding.pkl}
or
/graphs/cond_proc_drug/{entity_embedding.pkl, relation_embedding.pkl}
```
depending on the features used for the prediction tasks.

### 1.4 Node & Edge Clustering
The function for node & edge clustering:
``` bash
clustering() in data_prepare.py
```
We place some clustering results (only "_inv" as cluster embedding has large size) in 
``` bash
/clustering/
```

## 2. Personalized Knowledge Graph Composition
``` bash
process_sample_dataset() and process_graph() in data_prepare.py
&
get_subgraph() in graphcare.py
```

## 3. Bi-attention Augmented (BAT) Graph Neural Network
The implementation of our proposed BAT model is in
``` bash
/graphcare_/model.py
```

## 4. Training and Prediction
The creation of task-specific datasets (using PyHealth) is in 
``` bash
data_prepare.py
```
The training and prediction details are in
``` bash
graphcare.py
```

## Run Baseline Models
The scripts running baseline models are placed in 
``` bash
ehr_models.py
```

## Cite **GraphCare**
``` bash
@inproceedings{jiang2024graphcare,
  title = {GraphCare: Enhancing Healthcare Predictions with Personalized Knowledge Graphs},
  author = {Jiang, Pengcheng and Xiao, Cao and Cross, Adam and Sun, Jimeng},
  booktitle = {The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},
