osteoporosis	is a	bone disease
osteoporosis	causes	bone fragility
osteoporosis	increases risk of	fractures
osteoporosis	is associated with	aging
osteoporosis	is more common in	postmenopausal women
osteoporosis	may cause	vertebral fractures
osteoporosis	may cause	hip fractures
osteoporosis	may cause	wrist fractures
osteoporosis	is diagnosed by	DXA scan
osteoporosis	is indicated by	low bone density
osteoporosis	is treated with	bisphosphonates
osteoporosis	is treated with	calcium supplements
osteoporosis	is treated with	vitamin D
osteoporosis	is prevented by	weight-bearing exercise
osteoporosis	is worsened by	smoking
osteoporosis	is worsened by	alcohol abuse
osteoporosis	is linked to	glucocorticoid use
osteoporosis	has complication	chronic pain
osteoporosis	increases mortality risk	hip fractures
osteoporosis	requires	fall prevention
bisphosphonates	include	alendronate
bisphosphonates	include	risedronate
bisphosphonates	include	zoledronic acid
bisphosphonates	work by	inhibiting bone resorption
bisphosphonates	may cause	esophagitis
bisphosphonates	require	upright posture after administration
calcium	is essential for	bone health
calcium	is absorbed with	vitamin D
calcium carbonate	requires	stomach acid for absorption
calcium citrate	is better absorbed than	calcium carbonate
vitamin D	is synthesized from	sunlight exposure
vitamin D	enhances	calcium absorption
vitamin D deficiency	contributes to	osteoporosis
vertebral fractures	cause	height loss
vertebral fractures	may lead to	kyphosis
hip fractures	require	hospitalization
hip fractures	often need	surgical repair
hip fractures	increase risk of	deep vein thrombosis
wrist fractures	are common in	fall injuries
DXA scan	measures	bone mineral density
DXA scan	uses	low-dose x-rays
T-score	indicates	osteoporosis severity
FRAX score	predicts	fracture risk
weight-bearing exercise	includes	walking
weight-bearing exercise	includes	dancing
weight-bearing exercise	stimulates	bone formation
resistance training	strengthens	muscles
resistance training	supports	bones
smoking	reduces	estrogen levels
smoking	impairs	bone healing
alcohol	interferes with	calcium absorption
alcohol	increases	fall risk
glucocorticoids	inhibit	osteoblast activity
glucocorticoids	are used for	inflammation control
chronic pain	reduces	quality of life
chronic pain	leads to	mobility issues
hip fractures	have high	mortality rate
hip fractures	cause	prolonged immobility
fall prevention	includes	home safety measures
fall prevention	includes	vision correction
alendronate	is taken	weekly
alendronate	may cause	jaw osteonecrosis
risedronate	is taken	weekly or monthly
zoledronic acid	is administered	intravenously
zoledronic acid	is given	yearly
teriparatide	stimulates	bone formation
teriparatide	is a	parathyroid hormone analog
denosumab	inhibits	RANK ligand
denosumab	is given	every 6 months
raloxifene	is a	SERM
raloxifene	reduces	vertebral fractures
raloxifene	increases	thromboembolism risk
estrogen therapy	prevents	bone loss
estrogen therapy	increases	breast cancer risk
calcitonin	reduces	bone resorption
calcitonin	provides	pain relief
bone mineral density	peaks at	age 30
bone remodeling	involves	osteoclasts and osteoblasts
osteoclasts	resorb	bone tissue
osteoblasts	form	new bone
parathyroid hormone	regulates	calcium levels
high parathyroid hormone	causes	bone loss
calcium	is stored in	bones
magnesium	supports	bone health
vitamin K	aids in	bone mineralization
protein intake	affects	bone strength
malabsorption syndromes	lead to	osteoporosis
celiac disease	causes	calcium malabsorption
hyperthyroidism	accelerates	bone loss
rheumatoid arthritis	increases	osteoporosis risk
chronic kidney disease	affects	bone metabolism
proton pump inhibitors	may increase	fracture risk
anticonvulsants	may cause	bone loss
depression	is associated with	low bone density
sedentary lifestyle	contributes to	bone loss
obesity	may protect against	osteoporosis
corticosteroids	are risk factor for	osteoporosis
fracture liaison services	improve	post-fracture care
bone markers	monitor	treatment response
osteoporosis management	requires	multidisciplinary approach
