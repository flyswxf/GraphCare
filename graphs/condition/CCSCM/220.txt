intrauterine hypoxia	results from	umbilical cord compression
umbilical cord compression	occurs during	labor
labor	is monitored by	cardiotocography
cardiotocography	records	fetal heart rate
fetal heart rate	indicates	fetal distress
fetal distress	necessitates	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	improves	fetal oxygenation
intrauterine hypoxia	is associated with	meconium aspiration
meconium aspiration	causes	respiratory distress
respiratory distress	requires	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	supports	lung function
birth asphyxia	leads to	hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy	is treated with	therapeutic hypothermia
therapeutic hypothermia	prevents	brain damage
brain damage	affects	cognitive development
intrauterine hypoxia	is prevented by	maternal oxygen administration
maternal oxygen administration	increases	fetal oxygen supply
fetal oxygen supply	depends on	maternal hemoglobin
maternal hemoglobin	is increased by	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	prevents	maternal anemia
maternal anemia	contributes to	fetal hypoxia
birth asphyxia	increases risk of	neonatal death
neonatal death	is reduced by	skilled birth attendance
skilled birth attendance	includes	midwifery care
midwifery care	improves	birth outcomes
intrauterine hypoxia	is exacerbated by	maternal smoking
maternal smoking	causes	vasoconstriction
vasoconstriction	reduces	placental blood flow
placental blood flow	is essential for	fetal oxygenation
fetal oxygenation	maintains	cellular metabolism
birth asphyxia	results in	multiorgan dysfunction
multiorgan dysfunction	affects	kidney function
kidney function	is monitored by	creatinine levels
creatinine levels	indicate	renal impairment
intrauterine hypoxia	is associated with	preterm birth
preterm birth	increases risk of	respiratory distress syndrome
respiratory distress syndrome	is treated with	surfactant therapy
surfactant therapy	improves	lung compliance
lung compliance	is essential for	gas exchange
birth asphyxia	may lead to	visual impairments
visual impairments	are assessed by	ophthalmologic examination
ophthalmologic examination	detects	retinal damage
retinal damage	results from	oxygen toxicity
intrauterine hypoxia	is worsened by	maternal diabetes
maternal diabetes	causes	macrosomia
macrosomia	increases risk of	birth trauma
birth trauma	includes	brachial plexus injury
brachial plexus injury	requires	physical therapy
birth asphyxia	contributes to	hearing loss
hearing loss	is diagnosed by	auditory brainstem response
auditory brainstem response	evaluates	neural pathways
intrauterine hypoxia	is mitigated by	antenatal corticosteroids
antenatal corticosteroids	accelerate	lung maturation
lung maturation	prevents	neonatal respiratory failure
neonatal respiratory failure	requires	ECMO
ECMO	provides	cardiopulmonary support
birth asphyxia	is predicted by	Apgar score
Apgar score	assesses	neonatal viability
neonatal viability	determines	NICU admission
NICU admission	provides	intensive care
intrauterine hypoxia	is influenced by	maternal hypertension
maternal hypertension	reduces	uteroplacental perfusion
uteroplacental perfusion	delivers	nutrients to fetus
nutrients to fetus	support	fetal growth
birth asphyxia	causes	cardiac dysfunction
cardiac dysfunction	is managed with	inotropic support
inotropic support	improves	myocardial contractility
myocardial contractility	maintains	circulation
