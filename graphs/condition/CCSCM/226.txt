fracture of neck of femur	is a type of	hip fracture
fracture of neck of femur	commonly occurs in	elderly
fracture of neck of femur	caused by	osteoporosis
fracture of neck of femur	requires	surgical intervention
fracture of neck of femur	may lead to	immobility
fracture of neck of femur	associated with	high mortality
fracture of neck of femur	treated with	internal fixation
fracture of neck of femur	alternative treatment	hip replacement
fracture of neck of femur	causes	severe pain
fracture of neck of femur	requires	hospitalization
osteoporosis	is a risk factor for	fracture of neck of femur
elderly	have higher incidence of	fracture of neck of femur
hip replacement	can treat	fracture of neck of femur
internal fixation	stabilizes	fracture of neck of femur
immobility	may cause	pressure ulcers
hospitalization	increases risk of	hospital-acquired infections
severe pain	managed with	opioids
high mortality	related to	postoperative complications
surgical intervention	requires	anesthesia
fracture of neck of femur	may result in	disability
pressure ulcers	are a complication of	immobility
opioids	used for	pain management
anesthesia	has risks of	cardiovascular events
disability	leads to	decreased quality of life
hospital-acquired infections	include	pneumonia
postoperative complications	include	deep vein thrombosis
deep vein thrombosis	prevented with	anticoagulants
pneumonia	treated with	antibiotics
decreased quality of life	may lead to	depression
cardiovascular events	can be	myocardial infarction
anticoagulants	prevent	blood clots
antibiotics	combat	bacterial infections
depression	treated with	antidepressants
myocardial infarction	is a	heart attack
blood clots	can cause	pulmonary embolism
bacterial infections	require	antimicrobial therapy
antidepressants	regulate	serotonin levels
heart attack	treated with	revascularization
pulmonary embolism	is a	life-threatening condition
antimicrobial therapy	targets	pathogens
serotonin levels	affect	mood regulation
revascularization	restores	blood flow
life-threatening conditions	require	intensive care
pathogens	cause	infectious diseases
mood regulation	involves	neurotransmitters
blood flow	delivers	oxygen
intensive care	provided in	ICUs
infectious diseases	spread through	pathogens
neurotransmitters	include	dopamine
oxygen	is essential for	cellular respiration
ICUs	have specialized	medical equipment
dopamine	affects	reward system
cellular respiration	produces	ATP
medical equipment	includes	ventilators
reward system	influences	behavior
ATP	provides	cellular energy
ventilators	assist	breathing
behavior	can be modified by	therapy
cellular energy	powers	metabolic processes
breathing	delivers	oxygen to lungs
therapy	includes	physical therapy
metabolic processes	generate	waste products
lungs	exchange	gases
physical therapy	improves	mobility
waste products	include	carbon dioxide
gases	diffuse across	alveoli
mobility	prevents	muscle atrophy
carbon dioxide	is a	byproduct of metabolism
alveoli	are	air sacs
muscle atrophy	results from	disuse
byproduct of metabolism	excreted by	kidneys
air sacs	facilitate	gas exchange
disuse	leads to	strength loss
kidneys	filter	blood
gas exchange	maintains	homeostasis
strength loss	affects	daily activities
blood	transports	nutrients
homeostasis	regulates	body temperature
daily activities	require	energy expenditure
nutrients	include	glucose
body temperature	controlled by	hypothalamus
energy expenditure	measured in	calories
glucose	is a	carbohydrate
hypothalamus	regulates	pituitary gland
calories	represent	energy content
carbohydrate	provides	quick energy
pituitary gland	secretes	growth hormone
energy content	determines	nutritional value
quick energy	spikes	blood sugar
growth hormone	stimulates	tissue repair
nutritional value	assessed by	dietitians
blood sugar	regulated by	insulin
tissue repair	involves	cell proliferation
dietitians	recommend	balanced diets
insulin	produced by	pancreas
cell proliferation	requires	growth factors
balanced diets	include	proteins
pancreas	also secretes	glucagon
growth factors	stimulate	cell division
proteins	build	muscle tissue
