coronary atherosclerosis	is a	heart disease
coronary atherosclerosis	causes	myocardial infarction
coronary atherosclerosis	is caused by	high cholesterol
coronary atherosclerosis	is treated with	statins
statin	reduces	LDL cholesterol
LDL cholesterol	contributes to	plaque formation
plaque formation	narrows	coronary arteries
coronary arteries	supply blood to	heart muscle
heart muscle	requires	oxygen
oxygen deprivation	causes	angina
angina	is a symptom of	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	includes	coronary atherosclerosis
coronary atherosclerosis	increases risk of	heart failure
heart failure	results from	weakened heart muscle
weakened heart muscle	reduces	cardiac output
cardiac output	determines	blood circulation
blood circulation	delivers	nutrients
nutrient deficiency	affects	organ function
organ dysfunction	complicates	heart disease
heart disease	is managed with	beta blockers
beta blockers	decrease	heart rate
reduced heart rate	lowers	oxygen demand
oxygen demand	increases during	physical activity
physical activity	improves	cardiovascular health
cardiovascular health	prevents	atherosclerosis progression
atherosclerosis progression	leads to	arterial stenosis
arterial stenosis	requires	angioplasty
angioplasty	involves	stent placement
stent placement	maintains	arterial patency
arterial patency	ensures	blood flow
impaired blood flow	causes	ischemia
ischemia	may result in	tissue necrosis
tissue necrosis	leads to	myocardial scarring
myocardial scarring	affects	heart function
heart function	is measured by	ejection fraction
low ejection fraction	indicates	systolic dysfunction
systolic dysfunction	characterizes	heart failure
heart failure	may require	cardiac transplantation
cardiac transplantation	replaces	diseased heart
diseased heart	often has	ventricular hypertrophy
ventricular hypertrophy	develops from	chronic hypertension
chronic hypertension	damages	arterial endothelium
arterial endothelium	regulates	vascular tone
vascular tone	affects	blood pressure
high blood pressure	accelerates	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	increases	cardiovascular risk
cardiovascular risk	is assessed by	Framingham score
Framingham score	considers	cholesterol levels
cholesterol levels	are influenced by	diet
Mediterranean diet	reduces	heart disease risk
heart disease risk	is higher in	smokers
smoking	damages	vascular endothelium
vascular endothelium	produces	nitric oxide
nitric oxide	maintains	vasodilation
impaired vasodilation	causes	endothelial dysfunction
endothelial dysfunction	precedes	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	may cause	peripheral artery disease
peripheral artery disease	manifests as	claudication
claudication	indicates	arterial insufficiency
arterial insufficiency	requires	vascular surgery
vascular surgery	may involve	bypass grafting
bypass grafting	uses	autologous veins
autologous veins	are harvested from	legs
vein harvesting	risks	wound infection
wound infection	complicates	postoperative recovery
postoperative recovery	includes	cardiac rehabilitation
cardiac rehabilitation	improves	functional capacity
functional capacity	predicts	mortality risk
mortality risk	is reduced by	aspirin therapy
aspirin therapy	prevents	platelet aggregation
platelet aggregation	forms	blood clots
blood clots	cause	acute coronary syndrome
acute coronary syndrome	requires	emergency intervention
emergency intervention	includes	thrombolysis
thrombolysis	dissolves	arterial thrombi
arterial thrombi	obstruct	blood vessels
blood vessel obstruction	results in	infarction
infarction	damages	myocardium
myocardium	contains	cardiomyocytes
cardiomyocyte death	triggers	inflammatory response
inflammatory response	involves	cytokine release
cytokine release	exacerbates	tissue damage
tissue damage	leads to	fibrotic remodeling
fibrotic remodeling	stiffens	ventricular walls
stiff ventricles	impair	diastolic function
diastolic dysfunction	causes	pulmonary congestion
pulmonary congestion	manifests as	dyspnea
dyspnea	is relieved by	diuretics
diuretics	reduce	fluid overload
fluid overload	worsens	heart failure
heart failure	may lead to	cardiogenic shock
cardiogenic shock	requires	inotropic support
inotropic drugs	enhance	myocardial contractility
myocardial contractility	determines	stroke volume
stroke volume	combined with heart rate	equals cardiac output
cardiac output	maintains	organ perfusion
organ perfusion	ensures	cellular oxygenation
cellular oxygenation	prevents	anaerobic metabolism
anaerobic metabolism	produces	lactic acid
lactic acidosis	indicates	tissue hypoperfusion
