drowning	is classified by	E codes
drowning	is cause of	mortality
drowning	requires	resuscitation
drowning	leads to	hypoxia
hypoxia	causes	brain damage
brain damage	requires	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	involves	physical therapy
drowning	associated with	swimming pools
swimming pools	require	safety measures
safety measures	prevent	drowning
drowning	occurs in	bathtubs
bathtubs	need	supervision
supervision	reduces	child drowning
child drowning	indicates	neglect
neglect	leads to	legal consequences
drowning	causes	pulmonary edema
pulmonary edema	treated with	diuretics
furosemide	is a	diuretic
drowning	results in	respiratory arrest
respiratory arrest	requires	CPR
CPR	uses	defibrillator
defibrillator	delivers	electric shock
electric shock	restores	heart rhythm
drowning	leads to	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	corrected by	IV fluids
IV fluids	contain	sodium chloride
drowning	affects	body temperature
hypothermia	occurs after	cold water drowning
hypothermia	treated with	warming blankets
drowning	associated with	alcohol use
alcohol use	impairs	judgment
impaired judgment	increases	drowning risk
drowning	requires	emergency response
emergency response	involves	paramedics
paramedics	perform	intubation
intubation	maintains	airway
airway	ensures	oxygenation
oxygenation	prevents	organ failure
organ failure	leads to	ICU admission
ICU admission	requires	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	supports	breathing
drowning	causes	aspiration
aspiration	leads to	pneumonia
pneumonia	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	combat	infection
drowning	affects	neurological function
neurological function	assessed by	Glasgow Coma Scale
Glasgow Coma Scale	measures	consciousness
consciousness	indicates	prognosis
prognosis	guides	treatment plan
drowning	occurs during	boating
boating	requires	life jackets
life jackets	prevent	submersion
submersion	causes	asphyxia
asphyxia	leads to	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	treated with	epinephrine
epinephrine	stimulates	heart
drowning	related to	epilepsy
epilepsy	causes	seizures
seizures	increase	drowning risk
drowning	documented in	medical records
medical records	used for	research
research	improves	prevention strategies
prevention strategies	include	swimming lessons
swimming lessons	reduce	drowning incidents
drowning	associated with	flooding
flooding	creates	hazardous conditions
hazardous conditions	increase	rescue operations
rescue operations	involve	divers
divers	perform	underwater search
drowning	causes	metabolic acidosis
metabolic acidosis	corrected by	bicarbonate
bicarbonate	neutralizes	acid
drowning	leads to	multi-organ dysfunction
multi-organ dysfunction	requires	ECMO
ECMO	supports	circulation
circulation	delivers	oxygen
drowning	occurs in	lakes
lakes	have	unpredictable currents
unpredictable currents	cause	panic
panic	worsens	drowning situation
drowning	related to	suicide attempts
suicide attempts	require	psychiatric evaluation
psychiatric evaluation	assesses	mental health
mental health	affects	recovery
drowning	treated in	emergency department
emergency department	staffed by	physicians
physicians	order	diagnostic tests
diagnostic tests	include	chest X-ray
chest X-ray	detects	water inhalation
drowning	prevents	oxygen exchange
oxygen exchange	occurs in	alveoli
alveoli	damaged by	water
water	disrupts	surfactant
surfactant	maintains	lung function
drowning	common in	toddlers
toddlers	need	constant supervision
constant supervision	prevents	accidents
accidents	documented in	E codes
E codes	help track	drowning statistics
