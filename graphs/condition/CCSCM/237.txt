immunosuppressants	increase risk of	infection
complication of device	may cause	pain
pain	may require	analgesics
implant	may cause	inflammation
inflammation	may lead to	scarring
scarring	may require	surgery
graft	may cause	thrombosis
thrombosis	may lead to	ischemia
ischemia	may require	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	increase risk of	bleeding
bleeding	may require	transfusion
transfusion	carries risk of	infection
implant	may cause	mechanical failure
mechanical failure	may require	revision surgery
revision surgery	has risk of	complications
graft	may cause	anastomotic leak
anastomotic leak	may lead to	sepsis
sepsis	requires	ICU admission
ICU admission	increases risk of	mortality
implant	may cause	allergic reaction
allergic reaction	may lead to	dermatitis
dermatitis	may require	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	increase risk of	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	increases risk of	fractures
fractures	may require	fixation
fixation	may involve	metal implants
metal implants	may cause	metal toxicity
metal toxicity	may lead to	organ damage
organ damage	may require	transplantation
transplantation	requires	immunosuppression
immunosuppression	increases risk of	cancer
graft	may cause	stenosis
stenosis	may lead to	obstruction
obstruction	may require	stenting
stenting	may cause	restenosis
restenosis	may require	angioplasty
angioplasty	may cause	vessel rupture
vessel rupture	may lead to	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	may require	embolization
embolization	may cause	tissue necrosis
tissue necrosis	may require	debridement
debridement	may lead to	wound
wound	may require	dressing
dressing	may cause	maceration
maceration	may lead to	infection
implant	may cause	migration
migration	may lead to	perforation
perforation	may require	emergency surgery
emergency surgery	increases risk of	complications
graft	may cause	pseudoaneurysm
pseudoaneurysm	may lead to	rupture
rupture	may cause	hypovolemic shock
hypovolemic shock	requires	vasopressors
vasopressors	may cause	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	may require	cardioversion
cardioversion	may cause	burns
burns	may require	skin graft
skin graft	may cause	contracture
contracture	may require	physical therapy
physical therapy	may prevent	stiffness
stiffness	may limit	mobility
mobility	affects	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	surveys
surveys	help assess	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	affects	healthcare ratings
healthcare ratings	influence	reimbursement
reimbursement	affects	hospital finances
hospital finances	impact	equipment quality
equipment quality	affects	surgical outcomes
surgical outcomes	depend on	surgeon skill
surgeon skill	requires	training
training	involves	simulation
simulation	uses	models
models	help predict	complications
complications	increase	hospital stay
hospital stay	increases	costs
costs	affect	insurance premiums
insurance premiums	influence	access to care
access to care	affects	health disparities
health disparities	are studied by	epidemiologists
epidemiologists	use	statistics
statistics	help identify	risk factors
risk factors	guide	prevention strategies
prevention strategies	reduce	complications
complications	are recorded in	EHRs
EHRs	enable	data analysis
data analysis	supports	AI prediction
AI prediction	assists	clinical decision-making
clinical decision-making	improves	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	are tracked by	registries
registries	provide	research data
research data	informs	guidelines
guidelines	standardize	device implantation
