cardiac arrest	is caused by	ventricular fibrillation
ventricular fibrillation	is a type of	arrhythmia
cardiac arrest	requires	CPR
ventricular fibrillation	requires	defibrillation
defibrillation	restores	normal rhythm
CPR	maintains	blood circulation
cardiac arrest	causes	lack of oxygen
lack of oxygen	damages	brain
ventricular fibrillation	originates in	ventricles
ventricles	pump	blood
cardiac arrest	leads to	unconsciousness
unconsciousness	indicates	medical emergency
ventricular fibrillation	is detected by	ECG
ECG	measures	heart activity
cardiac arrest	has symptom	no pulse
no pulse	confirms	cardiac arrest
ventricular fibrillation	is treated with	antiarrhythmics
antiarrhythmics	stabilize	heart rhythm
cardiac arrest	has risk factor	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	narrows	arteries
ventricular fibrillation	follows	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	damages	heart muscle
cardiac arrest	has complication	organ failure
organ failure	results from	hypoxia
ventricular fibrillation	is prevented by	ICD
ICD	monitors	heart rhythm
cardiac arrest	occurs during	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	affects	heart function
ventricular fibrillation	worsens with	tachycardia
tachycardia	increases	heart rate
cardiac arrest	is associated with	sudden death
sudden death	occurs without	warning
ventricular fibrillation	is triggered by	stress
stress	activates	sympathetic system
cardiac arrest	has mortality rate	high
high mortality	indicates	severity
ventricular fibrillation	is common in	cardiomyopathy
cardiomyopathy	weakens	heart muscle
cardiac arrest	requires	emergency response
emergency response	includes	calling 911
ventricular fibrillation	is managed by	cardiologist
cardiologist	specializes in	heart disorders
cardiac arrest	follows	respiratory arrest
respiratory arrest	stops	breathing
ventricular fibrillation	is studied in	electrophysiology
electrophysiology	analyzes	electrical activity
cardiac arrest	is worsened by	delay
delay	reduces	survival chance
ventricular fibrillation	can recur	after treatment
recurrence	necessitates	follow-up
cardiac arrest	is preceded by	chest pain
chest pain	signals	heart problem
ventricular fibrillation	is influenced by	genetics
genetics	predispose to	arrhythmias
cardiac arrest	is more likely in	elderly
elderly	have	weaker hearts
ventricular fibrillation	is aggravated by	ischemia
ischemia	reduces	blood flow
cardiac arrest	can result from	drowning
drowning	causes	hypoxia
ventricular fibrillation	is linked to	long QT syndrome
long QT syndrome	prolongs	QT interval
cardiac arrest	is treated with	epinephrine
epinephrine	stimulates	heart
ventricular fibrillation	is inhibited by	beta blockers
beta blockers	slow	heart rate
cardiac arrest	is predicted by	low ejection fraction
low ejection fraction	indicates	weak pumping
ventricular fibrillation	is seen in	Brugada syndrome
Brugada syndrome	affects	sodium channels
cardiac arrest	is prevented by	healthy lifestyle
healthy lifestyle	reduces	heart risks
ventricular fibrillation	is exacerbated by	drugs
drugs	alter	heart rhythm
cardiac arrest	is fatal without	intervention
intervention	saves	lives
ventricular fibrillation	is controlled by	amiodarone
amiodarone	regulates	heartbeat
cardiac arrest	is confirmed by	flatline ECG
flatline ECG	shows	asystole
ventricular fibrillation	is contrasted with	atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation	occurs in	atria
cardiac arrest	is documented in	medical records
medical records	track	patient history
ventricular fibrillation	is researched in	clinical trials
clinical trials	test	new treatments
cardiac arrest	is mitigated by	bystander CPR
bystander CPR	improves	outcomes
ventricular fibrillation	is simulated in	labs
labs	study	heart models
cardiac arrest	is announced by	collapse
collapse	alerts	witnesses
ventricular fibrillation	is visualized with	electrograms
electrograms	display	electrical signals
cardiac arrest	is time-sensitive
time-sensitive	means	urgent
ventricular fibrillation	is influenced by	potassium levels
potassium levels	affect	conduction
cardiac arrest	is addressed in	ACLS protocols
ACLS protocols	guide	resuscitation
