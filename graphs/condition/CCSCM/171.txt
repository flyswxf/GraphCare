dysmenorrhea	is characterized by	painful periods
dysmenorrhea	may be caused by	prostaglandins
amenorrhea	is characterized by	absent periods
amenorrhea	may be caused by	extreme weight loss
menorrhagia	is characterized by	heavy bleeding
menorrhagia	may lead to	iron deficiency
oligomenorrhea	is characterized by	infrequent periods
oligomenorrhea	may be caused by	stress
polycystic ovary syndrome	is a cause of	irregular periods
polycystic ovary syndrome	is associated with	insulin resistance
endometriosis	is a cause of	pelvic pain
endometriosis	may lead to	adhesions
uterine fibroids	are a cause of	menorrhagia
uterine fibroids	may cause	pelvic pressure
hormonal imbalance	may involve	estrogen
hormonal imbalance	may involve	progesterone
thyroid dysfunction	may cause	menstrual irregularities
thyroid dysfunction	is diagnosed by	TSH test
prostaglandins	are involved in	uterine contractions
prostaglandins	may be inhibited by	NSAIDs
oral contraceptives	regulate	menstrual cycle
oral contraceptives	may cause	side effects
NSAIDs	reduce	menstrual pain
NSAIDs	inhibit	prostaglandin synthesis
iron supplements	treat	anemia
iron supplements	may cause	constipation
pelvic exam	evaluates	reproductive organs
blood tests	measure	hormone levels
ultrasound	visualizes	uterine abnormalities
lifestyle changes	include	stress management
lifestyle changes	may improve	menstrual symptoms
estrogen	regulates	endometrial growth
progesterone	prepares	uterus for pregnancy
TSH test	assesses	thyroid function
insulin resistance	is linked to	obesity
adhesions	may cause	chronic pain
chronic pain	may require	pain management
infertility	may result from	anovulation
anovulation	is a cause of	amenorrhea
heavy bleeding	may require	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	may include	hysterectomy
hysterectomy	is a treatment for	uterine fibroids
hysterectomy	results in	permanent amenorrhea
stress	affects	hypothalamus
hypothalamus	regulates	menstrual cycle
constipation	is a side effect of	iron therapy
constipation	may be relieved by	fiber intake
fiber intake	improves	digestive health
digestive health	is linked to	gut microbiota
gut microbiota	influences	immune system
immune system	may be affected by	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	is associated with	endometriosis
obesity	exacerbates	polycystic ovary syndrome
obesity	is managed by	diet and exercise
diet and exercise	improve	insulin sensitivity
insulin sensitivity	reduces	diabetes risk
diabetes risk	is increased by	metabolic syndrome
metabolic syndrome	includes	high blood pressure
high blood pressure	may be caused by	hormonal changes
hormonal changes	occur during	menopause
menopause	marks	end of menstruation
menopause	is associated with	hot flashes
hot flashes	are treated with	hormone replacement therapy
hormone replacement therapy	may increase	breast cancer risk
breast cancer risk	is influenced by	estrogen exposure
estrogen exposure	is higher in	early menarche
early menarche	is a risk factor for	menstrual disorders
uterine contractions	are necessary for	menstruation
menstruation	is regulated by	pituitary gland
pituitary gland	secretes	FSH
FSH	stimulates	ovarian follicles
ovarian follicles	produce	estrogen
estrogen	peaks during	follicular phase
follicular phase	precedes	ovulation
ovulation	is triggered by	LH surge
LH surge	is detected by	ovulation tests
ovulation tests	predict	fertile window
fertile window	is important for	conception
conception	requires	sperm and egg
sperm and egg	unite in	fertilization
fertilization	results in	pregnancy
pregnancy	prevents	menstruation
menstruation	resumes after	postpartum period
postpartum period	involves	hormonal adjustments
hormonal adjustments	affect	mood
