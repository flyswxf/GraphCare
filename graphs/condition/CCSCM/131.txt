respiratory failure	is a	medical condition
respiratory failure	may cause	hypoxia
respiratory failure	may cause	hypercapnia
respiratory failure	may lead to	cardiac arrest
respiratory failure	is treated with	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	requires	intubation
intubation	uses	endotracheal tube
respiratory failure	can result from	pneumonia
pneumonia	is caused by	bacterial infection
bacterial infection	is treated with	antibiotics
respiratory failure	can result from	COPD
COPD	is a	chronic lung disease
COPD	is caused by	smoking
respiratory failure	can result from	asthma
asthma	is treated with	bronchodilators
bronchodilators	include	albuterol
respiratory failure	can result from	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	is caused by	blood clot
blood clot	is treated with	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	include	heparin
respiratory failure	can result from	ARDS
ARDS	is a	lung injury
ARDS	is caused by	sepsis
sepsis	is treated with	IV antibiotics
respiratory failure	may require	ICU admission
ICU admission	involves	continuous monitoring
continuous monitoring	uses	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	measures	oxygen saturation
respiratory failure	may cause	respiratory acidosis
respiratory acidosis	is corrected with	bicarbonate
respiratory failure	may lead to	multi-organ failure
multi-organ failure	has high	mortality rate
respiratory failure	is diagnosed with	ABG test
ABG test	measures	blood gases
blood gases	indicate	acid-base balance
respiratory failure	can be	acute or chronic
chronic respiratory failure	requires	long-term oxygen therapy
long-term oxygen therapy	uses	oxygen concentrator
respiratory failure	may cause	respiratory arrest
respiratory arrest	requires	CPR
CPR	involves	chest compressions
chest compressions	maintain	circulation
respiratory failure	may require	tracheostomy
tracheostomy	creates	artificial airway
artificial airway	facilitates	breathing
respiratory failure	is associated with	high mortality
high mortality	is influenced by	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	heart disease
heart disease	increases	risk of respiratory failure
respiratory failure	may cause	brain damage
brain damage	results from	oxygen deprivation
oxygen deprivation	affects	cognitive function
respiratory failure	can be	type 1 or type 2
type 1 respiratory failure	involves	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	is treated with	supplemental oxygen
type 2 respiratory failure	involves	hypercapnia
hypercapnia	is managed with	non-invasive ventilation
non-invasive ventilation	uses	BiPAP
BiPAP	delivers	positive pressure
respiratory failure	may lead to	ventilator dependence
ventilator dependence	increases	hospitalization duration
hospitalization duration	affects	recovery time
respiratory failure	can result from	neuromuscular disease
neuromuscular disease	includes	ALS
ALS	causes	muscle weakness
muscle weakness	affects	breathing muscles
respiratory failure	may require	prone positioning
prone positioning	improves	oxygenation
oxygenation	is critical for	organ function
respiratory failure	is monitored with	capnography
capnography	measures	end-tidal CO2
end-tidal CO2	reflects	ventilation adequacy
respiratory failure	can result from	opioid overdose
opioid overdose	is reversed with	naloxone
naloxone	blocks	opioid receptors
respiratory failure	may cause	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	increases	right heart strain
right heart strain	can lead to	cor pulmonale
cor pulmonale	is a	heart condition
respiratory failure	may require	ECMO
ECMO	provides	extracorporeal oxygenation
extracorporeal oxygenation	bypasses	lungs
respiratory failure	is complicated by	ventilator-associated pneumonia
ventilator-associated pneumonia	is caused by	bacteria
bacteria	are treated with	broad-spectrum antibiotics
respiratory failure	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	are affected by	length of stay
length of stay	depends on	severity
severity	is assessed with	clinical scores
clinical scores	include	APACHE II
APACHE II	predicts	mortality risk
respiratory failure	may lead to	tracheal stenosis
tracheal stenosis	is a	complication of intubation
complication of intubation	requires	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	involves	tracheal resection
respiratory failure	can be	postoperative complication
postoperative complication	increases	readmission rate
readmission rate	reflects	quality of care
quality of care	impacts	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	depend on	timely intervention
