pulmonary heart disease	is a	heart condition
pulmonary heart disease	caused by	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	causes	right ventricular hypertrophy
right ventricular hypertrophy	leads to	heart failure
heart failure	increases risk of	mortality
pulmonary heart disease	associated with	chronic lung disease
chronic lung disease	includes	COPD
COPD	leads to	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	worsens	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	diagnosed with	echocardiography
echocardiography	measures	right ventricular pressure
right ventricular pressure	indicates	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	treated with	diuretics
diuretics	reduce	fluid retention
fluid retention	exacerbates	heart failure
pulmonary heart disease	managed with	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	improves	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	aggravates	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	linked to	sleep apnea
sleep apnea	causes	nocturnal hypoxemia
nocturnal hypoxemia	worsens	right heart strain
pulmonary heart disease	increases risk of	arrhythmias
arrhythmias	may lead to	sudden cardiac death
pulmonary heart disease	requires	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	prevent	thromboembolism
thromboembolism	exacerbates	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	monitored via	BNP levels
BNP levels	indicate	heart failure severity
heart failure severity	predicts	prognosis
pulmonary heart disease	influenced by	smoking
smoking	contributes to	COPD
COPD	progresses to	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	associated with	obesity
obesity	increases risk of	sleep apnea
sleep apnea	worsens	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	treated with	vasodilators
vasodilators	reduce	pulmonary artery pressure
pulmonary artery pressure	affects	right heart function
pulmonary heart disease	linked to	interstitial lung disease
interstitial lung disease	results in	pulmonary fibrosis
pulmonary fibrosis	raises	pulmonary vascular resistance
pulmonary vascular resistance	causes	right heart strain
pulmonary heart disease	screened via	chest X-ray
chest X-ray	shows	enlarged right ventricle
enlarged right ventricle	suggests	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	worsened by	high altitude
high altitude	induces	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	elevates	pulmonary artery pressure
pulmonary heart disease	managed by	pulmonary rehabilitation
pulmonary rehabilitation	improves	exercise capacity
exercise capacity	reflects	disease severity
pulmonary heart disease	correlated with	left heart disease
left heart disease	leads to	secondary pulmonary hypertension
secondary pulmonary hypertension	complicates	pulmonary heart disease
pulmonary heart disease	tested with	right heart catheterization
right heart catheterization	confirms	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	classified by	WHO groups
WHO groups	guide	treatment strategy
pulmonary heart disease	may require	lung transplantation
lung transplantation	resolves	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	recurs in	chronic rejection
chronic rejection	limits	transplant survival
pulmonary heart disease	influenced by	genetics
genetics	affect	BMPR2 mutations
BMPR2 mutations	predispose to	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	treated with	endothelin receptor antagonists
endothelin receptor antagonists	reduce	vascular resistance
vascular resistance	impacts	cardiac output
pulmonary heart disease	aggravated by	pregnancy
pregnancy	increases	cardiac workload
cardiac workload	stresses	right ventricle
pulmonary heart disease	contraindicates	high-intensity exercise
high-intensity exercise	risks	acute decompensation
acute decompensation	leads to	hospitalization
pulmonary heart disease	monitored by	6-minute walk test
6-minute walk test	assesses	functional capacity
functional capacity	predicts	survival
pulmonary heart disease	associated with	liver congestion
liver congestion	results from	right heart failure
right heart failure	causes	ascites
ascites	managed with	paracentesis
pulmonary heart disease	linked to	thrombophilia
thrombophilia	increases risk of	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	worsens	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary heart disease	treated with	PDE-5 inhibitors
PDE-5 inhibitors	dilate	pulmonary arteries
pulmonary arteries	carry	deoxygenated blood
deoxygenated blood	returns to	right atrium
right atrium	contracts into	right ventricle
right ventricle	pumps to	pulmonary artery
pulmonary artery	supplies	lungs
lungs	oxygenate	blood
oxygenated blood	enters	left heart
left heart	circulates	systemic blood
systemic blood	delivers	oxygen to tissues
tissues	require	oxygen for metabolism
metabolism	produces	carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide	exhaled by	lungs
lungs	impaired in	pulmonary heart disease
pulmonary heart disease	reduces	quality of life
