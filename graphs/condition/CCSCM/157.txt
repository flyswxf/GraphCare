acute renal failure	is a	kidney disorder
acute renal failure	may lead to	electrolyte imbalance
acute renal failure	may cause	fluid overload
acute renal failure	is diagnosed by	creatinine test
acute renal failure	is treated with	dialysis
dialysis	removes	toxins
dialysis	requires	vascular access
acute renal failure	may require	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases risk of	infection
acute renal failure	is associated with	hypotension
hypotension	may result from	blood loss
acute renal failure	can cause	uremia
uremia	affects	brain function
acute renal failure	may follow	sepsis
sepsis	triggers	systemic inflammation
acute renal failure	is common in	ICU patients
ICU patients	often receive	mechanical ventilation
acute renal failure	may result from	nephrotoxins
contrast dye	is a	nephrotoxin
acute renal failure	can follow	cardiac surgery
cardiac surgery	may cause	ischemia
ischemia	damages	kidney tissue
acute renal failure	is monitored by	urine output
oliguria	is a sign of	renal dysfunction
acute renal failure	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	depends on	comorbidities
diabetes	is a risk factor for	renal failure
hypertension	contributes to	kidney damage
acute renal failure	may require	fluid restriction
fluid restriction	prevents	pulmonary edema
pulmonary edema	impairs	oxygen exchange
acute renal failure	alters	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	affects	medication dosing
gentamicin	requires dose adjustment in	renal failure
acute renal failure	may cause	hyperkalemia
hyperkalemia	can lead to	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	may require	ECG monitoring
acute renal failure	often follows	dehydration
dehydration	results from	vomiting
vomiting	can be caused by	gastroenteritis
acute renal failure	is assessed by	GFR
GFR	estimates	kidney function
acute renal failure	may progress to	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	requires	long-term management
acute renal failure	can result from	obstruction
kidney stones	cause	urinary obstruction
urinary obstruction	leads to	hydronephrosis
acute renal failure	is treated with	diuretics
furosemide	is a	loop diuretic
diuretics	promote	sodium excretion
acute renal failure	may require	nutritional support
nutritional support	limits	protein intake
protein restriction	reduces	uremic toxins
acute renal failure	is complicated by	anemia
anemia	is treated with	erythropoietin
erythropoietin	stimulates	RBC production
acute renal failure	increases risk of	bleeding
bleeding risk	is due to	platelet dysfunction
platelet dysfunction	results from	uremia
acute renal failure	may follow	rhabdomyolysis
rhabdomyolysis	releases	myoglobin
myoglobin	damages	renal tubules
acute renal failure	can result from	vasculitis
vasculitis	causes	vascular inflammation
vascular inflammation	impairs	blood flow
acute renal failure	is associated with	metabolic acidosis
metabolic acidosis	requires	bicarbonate therapy
bicarbonate therapy	corrects	pH imbalance
acute renal failure	may cause	pericarditis
pericarditis	presents with	chest pain
chest pain	may indicate	cardiac tamponade
acute renal failure	is worsened by	nephrotoxic drugs
NSAIDs	are	nephrotoxic drugs
nephrotoxic drugs	should be avoided in	renal impairment
acute renal failure	may require	renal replacement therapy
renal replacement therapy	includes	CRRT
CRRT	provides	continuous filtration
acute renal failure	is predicted by	risk scores
risk scores	incorporate	laboratory values
laboratory values	include	serum creatinine
acute renal failure	may follow	contrast exposure
contrast exposure	occurs during	CT scans
CT scans	provide	diagnostic imaging
acute renal failure	can result from	hemolysis
hemolysis	releases	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	precipitates in	renal tubules
acute renal failure	is managed by	nephrologists
nephrologists	specialize in	kidney diseases
kidney diseases	include	glomerulonephritis
acute renal failure	may improve with	volume expansion
volume expansion	uses	IV fluids
IV fluids	restore	circulation
acute renal failure	is prevented by	hydration
hydration	maintains	renal perfusion
renal perfusion	depends on	cardiac output
cardiac output	is reduced in	heart failure
acute renal failure	may complicate	liver disease
liver disease	causes	hepatorenal syndrome
hepatorenal syndrome	involves	vasoconstriction
vasoconstriction	reduces	kidney perfusion
