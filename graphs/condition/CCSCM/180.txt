ectopic pregnancy	is a	pregnancy complication
ectopic pregnancy	occurs in	fallopian tube
ectopic pregnancy	may cause	abdominal pain
ectopic pregnancy	may cause	vaginal bleeding
ectopic pregnancy	requires	medical intervention
ectopic pregnancy	is diagnosed with	ultrasound
ectopic pregnancy	is diagnosed with	hCG test
ectopic pregnancy	may lead to	rupture
rupture	may cause	internal bleeding
internal bleeding	requires	emergency surgery
ectopic pregnancy	is treated with	methotrexate
methotrexate	is a	chemotherapy drug
methotrexate	stops cell growth	trophoblasts
ectopic pregnancy	may require	salpingectomy
salpingectomy	is a	surgical procedure
salpingectomy	removes	fallopian tube
ectopic pregnancy	increases risk of	infertility
infertility	may require	IVF
IVF	bypasses	fallopian tubes
ectopic pregnancy	has risk factor	pelvic inflammatory disease
pelvic inflammatory disease	is caused by	infection
infection	may be	chlamydia
chlamydia	is a	sexually transmitted infection
ectopic pregnancy	has risk factor	smoking
smoking	damages	cilia
cilia	help move	fertilized egg
ectopic pregnancy	has risk factor	previous ectopic pregnancy
previous ectopic pregnancy	increases chance of	recurrence
ectopic pregnancy	has risk factor	tubal surgery
tubal surgery	may cause	scarring
scarring	may block	fallopian tube
ectopic pregnancy	has symptom	shoulder pain
shoulder pain	indicates	internal bleeding
ectopic pregnancy	has symptom	dizziness
dizziness	suggests	blood loss
ectopic pregnancy	may mimic	miscarriage
miscarriage	involves	uterine bleeding
uterine bleeding	differs from	ectopic bleeding
ectopic pregnancy	requires	differential diagnosis
differential diagnosis	rules out	appendicitis
appendicitis	causes	right lower quadrant pain
ectopic pregnancy	can be	life-threatening
life-threatening condition	requires	hospitalization
hospitalization	involves	close monitoring
ectopic pregnancy	affects	future fertility
future fertility	depends on	tube preservation
tube preservation	may involve	salpingostomy
salpingostomy	removes	ectopic tissue
salpingostomy	preserves	fallopian tube
ectopic pregnancy	may recur in	remaining tube
remaining tube	may have	existing damage
existing damage	increases risk of	repeat ectopic
ectopic pregnancy	has association	IUD use
IUD use	prevents	intrauterine pregnancy
intrauterine pregnancy	is normal	pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	is abnormal	implantation
implantation	normally occurs	uterus
uterus	is designed for	pregnancy
fallopian tube	is not designed for	pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	causes	tubal stretching
tubal stretching	leads to	pain
pain	is a	warning sign
warning sign	prompts	medical attention
medical attention	prevents	complications
complications	include	hemorrhagic shock
hemorrhagic shock	results from	blood loss
blood loss	requires	transfusion
transfusion	replaces	blood volume
ectopic pregnancy	has mortality risk
mortality risk	depends on	early detection
early detection	requires	awareness
awareness	comes from	patient education
patient education	covers	risk factors
risk factors	should prompt	early testing
early testing	involves	hCG monitoring
hCG monitoring	tracks	pregnancy hormones
pregnancy hormones	rise abnormally in	ectopic
abnormal rise	indicates	problem
problem	requires	investigation
investigation	uses	transvaginal ultrasound
transvaginal ultrasound	visualizes	fallopian tubes
visualization	confirms	ectopic location
ectopic location	determines	treatment
treatment	may be	medical
medical treatment	avoids	surgery
surgery	is necessary for	rupture
rupture	causes	acute abdomen
acute abdomen	is a	surgical emergency
surgical emergency	demands	rapid response
rapid response	saves lives
ectopic pregnancy	affects	mental health
mental health	may require	counseling
counseling	helps with	pregnancy loss
pregnancy loss	is traumatic
trauma	affects	future pregnancies
future pregnancies	need	early monitoring
early monitoring	detects	problems
problems	can be	managed
management	improves	outcomes
outcomes	depend on	timely care
