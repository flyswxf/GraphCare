clubbing	indicates	chronic hypoxia
chronic hypoxia	treated with	oxygen therapy
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	managed with	vasodilators
cystic fibrosis	increases risk of	depression
depression	treated with	antidepressants
cystic fibrosis	requires	regular exercise
regular exercise	improves	lung capacity
cystic fibrosis	may cause	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	corrected with	oral rehydration
cystic fibrosis	monitored via	sputum culture
sputum culture	identifies	bacterial infections
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	treated with	mechanical ventilation
cystic fibrosis	associated with	nasal polyps
nasal polyps	removed via	surgery
