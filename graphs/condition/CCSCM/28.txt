symptom burden	managed with	supportive care
supportive care	includes	pain management
pain management	uses	opioids
opioids	risk includes	dependence
dependence	requires	careful monitoring
careful monitoring	involves	regular follow-ups
regular follow-ups	include	physical exams
physical exams	assess	disease status
disease status	guides	treatment decisions
treatment decisions	consider	patient preferences
patient preferences	influenced by	cultural factors
cultural factors	affect	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	impacts	outcomes
outcomes	measured via	survival statistics
survival statistics	used for	prognosis estimation
prognosis estimation	informs	treatment planning
treatment planning	involves	multidisciplinary team
