oxygen therapy	is a	supportive treatment
hospitalization	is required for	severe cases
smoking	is a risk factor for	respiratory disease
air pollution	is a risk factor for	respiratory disease
aging	is a risk factor for	respiratory disease
COPD	is a type of	chronic respiratory disease
asthma	is a type of	chronic respiratory disease
pneumonia	is a type of	respiratory infection
dyspnea	is a symptom of	respiratory disease
cough	is a symptom of	respiratory disease
wheezing	is a symptom of	respiratory disease
hypoxia	is a complication of	respiratory disease
respiratory failure	is a complication of	respiratory disease
chest X-ray	is a diagnostic tool for	respiratory disease
spirometry	is a diagnostic tool for	respiratory disease
vaccination	prevents	respiratory infection
smoking cessation	improves	respiratory health
cardiovascular disease	is worsened by	hypoxia
mortality	is increased by	respiratory failure
readmission	is increased by	chronic respiratory disease
respiratory disease	affects	lung function
lung function	is measured by	spirometry
bacterial infection	is treated with	antibiotics
anti-inflammatory drug	reduces	inflammation
inflammation	is a feature of	respiratory disease
severe cases	require	intensive care
intensive care	is a type of	hospitalization
chronic respiratory disease	requires	long-term management
long-term management	includes	medication adherence
medication adherence	improves	disease control
disease control	reduces	complications
complications	increase	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	are affected by	hospitalization
respiratory infection	is caused by	pathogens
pathogens	include	bacteria
pathogens	include	viruses

life-threatening condition	requires	emergency care
emergency care	is provided in	hospitals
hospitals	have	intensive care units
intensive care units	treat	critical patients
critical patients	may require	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	supports	breathing
breathing	is impaired by	respiratory disease
impaired breathing	causes	dyspnea
dyspnea	is assessed by	Borg scale
Borg scale	measures	perceived exertion
perceived exertion	reflects	disease severity
disease severity	determines	treatment plan
treatment plan	includes	medication
medication	has	side effects
side effects	may include	nausea
nausea	is a common side effect
common side effects	are managed with	supportive care
supportive care	includes	hydration
hydration	improves	patient comfort
patient comfort	is important for	recovery
recovery	depends on	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	is influenced by	patient education
patient education	improves	self-management
self-management	reduces	hospital visits
hospital visits	are associated with	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	is a metric for	system efficiency
system efficiency	affects	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	are measured by	mortality rates
mortality rates	are influenced by	early intervention
early intervention	requires	timely diagnosis
timely diagnosis	depends on	screening programs
