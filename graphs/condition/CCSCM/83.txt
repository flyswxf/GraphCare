epilepsy	is a	neurological disorder
convulsions	are a symptom of	epilepsy
epilepsy	may cause	loss of consciousness
epilepsy	is treated with	anticonvulsants
carbamazepine	is an	anticonvulsant
valproate	is an	anticonvulsant
lamotrigine	is an	anticonvulsant
epilepsy	can lead to	status epilepticus
status epilepticus	is a	medical emergency
epilepsy	is diagnosed by	EEG
EEG	measures	brain activity
epilepsy	may be caused by	brain injury
brain injury	can result from	trauma
epilepsy	is associated with	genetic mutations
genetic mutations	may affect	ion channels
ion channels	regulate	neuronal excitability
epilepsy	increases risk of	sudden death
sudden death	may result from	cardiac arrhythmia
epilepsy	is comorbid with	depression
depression	is treated with	antidepressants
epilepsy	may worsen with	sleep deprivation
sleep deprivation	affects	cognitive function
epilepsy	requires	long-term management
long-term management	includes	medication adherence
medication adherence	prevents	seizure recurrence
seizure recurrence	reduces	quality of life
epilepsy	may require	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	includes	temporal lobectomy
temporal lobectomy	removes	epileptogenic tissue
epilepsy	is monitored with	seizure diaries
seizure diaries	track	seizure frequency
seizure frequency	indicates	treatment efficacy
epilepsy	can be triggered by	flashing lights
flashing lights	stimulate	photosensitive epilepsy
photosensitive epilepsy	is a subtype of	epilepsy
epilepsy	may coexist with	migraines
migraines	are treated with	triptans
epilepsy	increases risk of	fractures
fractures	may result from	seizure falls
seizure falls	cause	physical injury
epilepsy	is managed by	neurologists
neurologists	specialize in	brain disorders
epilepsy	may involve	hippocampal sclerosis
hippocampal sclerosis	is seen in	MRI
MRI	provides	brain imaging
epilepsy	is linked to	febrile seizures
febrile seizures	occur in	childhood
childhood epilepsy	may resolve with age
epilepsy	can be inherited	genetic predisposition
genetic predisposition	increases	seizure susceptibility
epilepsy	may respond to	ketogenic diet
ketogenic diet	alters	metabolism
metabolism	affects	seizure threshold
epilepsy	is exacerbated by	stress
stress	triggers	cortisol release
cortisol	influences	neuronal activity
epilepsy	requires	emergency medication
emergency medication	includes	benzodiazepines
benzodiazepines	act on	GABA receptors
GABA receptors	inhibit	neuronal firing
epilepsy	may lead to	cognitive decline
cognitive decline	affects	memory
memory	is impaired by	frequent seizures
epilepsy	is studied in	animal models
animal models	simulate	human seizures
human seizures	vary in	severity
epilepsy	may involve	cortical dysplasia
cortical dysplasia	is a	brain malformation
brain malformation	disrupts	neural circuits
epilepsy	is screened for	drug resistance
drug resistance	complicates	treatment
treatment failure	necessitates	alternative therapies
epilepsy	is associated with	SUDEP
SUDEP	stands for	sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
SUDEP	is prevented by	seizure control
epilepsy	may involve	autoimmune mechanisms
autoimmune mechanisms	target	brain proteins
brain proteins	regulate	synaptic transmission
epilepsy	is influenced by	hormones
hormones	fluctuate during	menstrual cycle
menstrual cycle	affects	catamenial epilepsy
catamenial epilepsy	worsens during	menstruation
epilepsy	may benefit from	vagus nerve stimulation
vagus nerve stimulation	modulates	brain activity
brain activity	is measured by	MEG
MEG	detects	magnetic fields
epilepsy	is researched via	clinical trials
clinical trials	test	new drugs
new drugs	aim to	reduce side effects
side effects	include	dizziness
dizziness	is a symptom of	drug toxicity
drug toxicity	requires	dose adjustment
epilepsy	may correlate with	autism
autism	is a	developmental disorder
developmental disorder	affects	communication
epilepsy	is more common in	low-income countries
low-income countries	lack	healthcare access
healthcare access	improves	treatment outcomes
treatment outcomes	depend on	early diagnosis
early diagnosis	enables	timely intervention
