pedal cyclist	is classified under	E codes
E codes	describe	external causes of injury
pedal cyclist injury	is not	motor vehicle traffic accident
pedal cyclist	may involve	bicycle accident
bicycle accident	may result in	trauma
trauma	may require	emergency care
emergency care	involves	triage
triage	prioritizes	treatment urgency
treatment urgency	affects	hospital admission
hospital admission	may lead	inpatient care
inpatient care	includes	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	improves	mobility
mobility	is assessed by	physical therapy
physical therapy	prevents	long-term disability
long-term disability	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	are influenced by	injury severity
injury severity	is measured by	trauma score
trauma score	predicts	mortality risk
mortality risk	affects	life insurance
life insurance	covers	accidental death
accidental death	may result from	head injury
head injury	is prevented by	helmet use
helmet use	reduces	brain trauma
brain trauma	requires	neurological monitoring
neurological monitoring	detects	intracranial pressure
intracranial pressure	is treated with	osmotic diuretics
osmotic diuretics	include	mannitol
mannitol	decreases	cerebral edema
cerebral edema	worsens	Glasgow Coma Scale
Glasgow Coma Scale	assesses	consciousness level
consciousness level	determines	ICU admission
ICU admission	necessitates	ventilator support
ventilator support	prevents	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	is a complication of	polytrauma
polytrauma	involves	multiple fractures
multiple fractures	require	surgical fixation
surgical fixation	uses	orthopedic implants
orthopedic implants	may cause	infection
infection	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	bacterial growth
bacterial growth	is identified by	culture test
culture test	guides	antibiotic selection
antibiotic selection	avoids	drug resistance
drug resistance	increases	treatment failure
treatment failure	leads to	prolonged hospitalization
prolonged hospitalization	raises	readmission risk
readmission risk	is reduced by	discharge planning
discharge planning	includes	home care
home care	supports	recovery process
recovery process	depends on	patient compliance
patient compliance	improves with	education
education	addresses	risk factors
risk factors	include	alcohol use
alcohol use	impairs	coordination
coordination	affects	cycling safety
cycling safety	is enhanced by	reflective gear
reflective gear	increases	visibility
visibility	prevents	nighttime accidents
nighttime accidents	involve	poor lighting
poor lighting	is mitigated by	street lamps
street lamps	are maintained by	municipal authorities
municipal authorities	implement	traffic laws
traffic laws	regulate	cycling lanes
cycling lanes	reduce	pedestrian collisions
pedestrian collisions	cause	soft tissue injury
soft tissue injury	is treated with	RICE therapy
RICE therapy	stands for	rest ice compression elevation
elevation	reduces	swelling
swelling	indicates	inflammation
inflammation	is mediated by	cytokines
cytokines	are targeted by	anti-inflammatory drugs
anti-inflammatory drugs	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	relieve	pain
pain	is assessed by	visual analog scale
visual analog scale	measures	discomfort level
discomfort level	affects	quality of life
quality of life	is evaluated by	SF-36 questionnaire
SF-36 questionnaire	assesses	physical function
physical function	determines	return-to-work
return-to-work	depends on	sick leave duration
sick leave duration	is documented by	medical certificate
medical certificate	is issued by	physician
physician	prescribes	analgesics
analgesics	alleviate	chronic pain
chronic pain	may lead	opioid use
opioid use	risks	addiction
addiction	requires	substance abuse treatment
substance abuse treatment	includes	counseling
counseling	addresses	psychological distress
psychological distress	is measured by	depression scale
depression scale	screens for	mental health disorders
mental health disorders	affect	recovery outcomes
recovery outcomes	are tracked by	electronic health records
electronic health records	facilitate	data analysis
data analysis	identifies	injury trends
injury trends	inform	public health policies
public health policies	promote	accident prevention
accident prevention	reduces	healthcare burden
healthcare burden	is quantified by	disability-adjusted life years
disability-adjusted life years	reflect	population health
