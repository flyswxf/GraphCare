aspiration pneumonitis	caused by	food/vomitus
aspiration pneumonitis	is a	lung inflammation
food/vomitus	contains	gastric acid
gastric acid	damages	lung tissue
aspiration pneumonitis	may lead to	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	requires	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	is managed by	ICU team
aspiration pneumonitis	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	prevent	secondary infection
secondary infection	worsens	pneumonia
pneumonia	increases	mortality risk
mortality risk	depends on	comorbidities
aspiration pneumonitis	more common in	elderly patients
elderly patients	have higher	aspiration risk
aspiration risk	increased by	dysphagia
dysphagia	assessed with	swallowing study
swallowing study	performed by	speech therapist
speech therapist	recommends	diet modification
diet modification	reduces	aspiration risk
aspiration pneumonitis	prevented by	head elevation
head elevation	decreases	reflux
reflux	contributes to	aspiration
aspiration pneumonitis	may cause	ARDS
ARDS	requires	high PEEP
high PEEP	managed in	ICU
aspiration pneumonitis	diagnosed with	chest X-ray
chest X-ray	shows	infiltrates
infiltrates	indicate	lung injury
lung injury	leads to	hypoxia
hypoxia	treated with	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	delivered via	nasal cannula
nasal cannula	provides	low-flow oxygen
low-flow oxygen	improves	oxygen saturation
oxygen saturation	monitored with	pulse oximeter
pulse oximeter	attached to	finger
aspiration pneumonitis	associated with	altered mental status
altered mental status	increases	aspiration risk
aspiration risk	higher in	stroke patients
stroke patients	often have	swallowing difficulty
swallowing difficulty	evaluated with	FEES
FEES	stands for	fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing
aspiration pneumonitis	may require	bronchoscopy
bronchoscopy	removes	foreign material
foreign material	includes	food particles
food particles	trigger	inflammatory response
inflammatory response	releases	cytokines
cytokines	cause	fever
fever	treated with	antipyretics
antipyretics	include	acetaminophen
acetaminophen	reduces	fever
aspiration pneumonitis	increases	hospital stay
hospital stay	raises	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	impacted by	complications
complications	include	sepsis
sepsis	treated with	IV fluids
IV fluids	maintain	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored with	sphygmomanometer
sphygmomanometer	measures	systolic pressure
systolic pressure	indicates	cardiovascular health
cardiovascular health	affects	recovery
recovery	faster in	younger patients
younger patients	have better	lung reserve
lung reserve	protects against	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	treated with	intubation
intubation	performed by	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	administers	sedatives
sedatives	reduce	patient discomfort
patient discomfort	affects	cooperation
cooperation	needed for	treatment success
treatment success	measured by	symptom resolution
symptom resolution	includes	normalized breathing
normalized breathing	confirmed with	auscultation
auscultation	performed with	stethoscope
stethoscope	detects	lung sounds
lung sounds	indicate	aeration
aeration	improved by	chest physiotherapy
chest physiotherapy	involves	percussion
percussion	loosens	secretions
secretions	cleared by	suctioning
suctioning	prevents	airway obstruction
airway obstruction	causes	stridor
stridor	signals	upper airway issue
upper airway issue	may require	tracheostomy
tracheostomy	bypasses	vocal cords
vocal cords	protect	lower airway
lower airway	includes	bronchi
bronchi	branch into	bronchioles
bronchioles	lead to	alveoli
alveoli	facilitate	gas exchange
gas exchange	impaired in	aspiration pneumonitis
aspiration pneumonitis	linked to	gastric pH
gastric pH	lowered by	proton pump inhibitors
proton pump inhibitors	include	omeprazole
omeprazole	reduces	acid production
acid production	contributes to	mucosal damage
mucosal damage	heals with	time
time	affected by	patient nutrition
patient nutrition	optimized with	dietary consult
dietary consult	recommends	high-protein diet
high-protein diet	promotes	tissue repair
