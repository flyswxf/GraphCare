pregnancy	is a	physiological condition
pregnancy	may result in	delivery
delivery	can be	vaginal birth
delivery	can be	cesarean section
pregnancy	has symptom	morning sickness
pregnancy	requires	prenatal care
prenatal care	includes	ultrasound
ultrasound	detects	fetal development
fetal development	depends on	maternal nutrition
maternal nutrition	requires	folic acid
folic acid	prevents	neural tube defects
neural tube defects	affect	newborn health
newborn health	depends on	Apgar score
Apgar score	assesses	newborn vitality
pregnancy	may cause	gestational diabetes
gestational diabetes	increases risk of	macrosomia
macrosomia	complicates	vaginal birth
vaginal birth	may require	episiotomy
episiotomy	prevents	perineal tearing
perineal tearing	causes	postpartum pain
postpartum pain	may require	analgesics
analgesics	include	acetaminophen
pregnancy	may cause	preeclampsia
preeclampsia	requires	blood pressure monitoring
blood pressure monitoring	detects	hypertension
hypertension	increases risk of	preterm birth
preterm birth	leads to	NICU admission
NICU admission	provides	neonatal care
neonatal care	includes	respiratory support
respiratory support	may involve	CPAP
pregnancy	may cause	anemia
anemia	is treated with	iron supplements
iron supplements	may cause	constipation
constipation	is relieved by	fiber intake
fiber intake	includes	fruits
pregnancy	requires	weight management
weight management	prevents	obesity
obesity	increases risk of	cesarean section
cesarean section	requires	surgical incision
surgical incision	may lead to	infection
infection	is treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	may cause	diarrhea
diarrhea	leads to	dehydration
dehydration	requires	fluid replacement
fluid replacement	includes	oral rehydration
pregnancy	may cause	back pain
back pain	is relieved by	physical therapy
physical therapy	includes	pelvic exercises
pelvic exercises	strengthen	pelvic floor
pelvic floor	supports	bladder control
bladder control	may be lost in	urinary incontinence
urinary incontinence	is common in	postpartum period
postpartum period	includes	uterine involution
uterine involution	is monitored by	lochia
lochia	indicates	healing progress
healing progress	depends on	rest
rest	is essential for	recovery
recovery	may involve	lactation
lactation	produces	breast milk
breast milk	provides	infant immunity
infant immunity	protects against	infections
infections	may require	vaccination
vaccination	prevents	childhood diseases
pregnancy	may cause	varicose veins
varicose veins	result from	venous pressure
venous pressure	is reduced by	leg elevation
leg elevation	improves	circulation
circulation	is essential for	fetal oxygenation
fetal oxygenation	depends on	placental function
placental function	may be impaired by	smoking
smoking	increases risk of	low birth weight
low birth weight	leads to	developmental delays
developmental delays	require	early intervention
early intervention	includes	speech therapy
pregnancy	may cause	heartburn
heartburn	is relieved by	antacids
antacids	neutralize	stomach acid
stomach acid	aids in	digestion
digestion	is affected by	hormonal changes
hormonal changes	include	progesterone
progesterone	supports	uterine lining
uterine lining	nourishes	embryo
embryo	develops into	fetus
fetus	grows in	amniotic sac
amniotic sac	contains	amniotic fluid
amniotic fluid	cushions	fetus
fetus	is monitored by	fetal heart rate
fetal heart rate	indicates	fetal wellbeing
fetal wellbeing	is assessed by	Doppler
Doppler	uses	ultrasound waves
ultrasound waves	create	fetal image
fetal image	shows	growth parameters
growth parameters	include	biparietal diameter
biparietal diameter	measures	head size
head size	correlates with	gestational age
gestational age	determines	due date
due date	is estimated by	last menstrual period
last menstrual period	marks	conception timing
conception timing	affects	fertility window
fertility window	is optimal for	conception
