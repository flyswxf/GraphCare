allergic reactions	is a	immune response
allergic reactions	may cause	anaphylaxis
allergic reactions	are triggered by	allergens
allergens	include	pollen
allergens	include	dust mites
allergens	include	pet dander
allergens	include	food
food allergens	include	peanuts
food allergens	include	shellfish
allergic reactions	involve	histamine release
histamine	causes	inflammation
histamine	causes	itching
histamine	causes	swelling
allergic reactions	are treated with	antihistamines
diphenhydramine	is an	antihistamine
loratadine	is an	antihistamine
antihistamines	block	histamine receptors
severe allergic reactions	require	epinephrine
epinephrine	is administered via	auto-injector
auto-injector	contains	epinephrine
allergic reactions	may lead to	asthma attack
asthma	is managed with	bronchodilators
albuterol	is a	bronchodilator
allergic reactions	can cause	hives
hives	are treated with	corticosteroids
prednisone	is a	corticosteroid
allergic reactions	may result in	angioedema
angioedema	involves	subcutaneous swelling
allergic reactions	are diagnosed with	skin tests
skin tests	detect	allergen sensitivity
allergic reactions	can be mitigated by	avoidance
avoidance	reduces	allergen exposure
allergic reactions	may require	immunotherapy
immunotherapy	involves	allergy shots
allergy shots	contain	small allergen doses
allergic reactions	are common in	atopic individuals
atopy	predisposes to	eczema
eczema	is characterized by	itchy skin
allergic reactions	can affect	respiratory system
respiratory system	includes	lungs
allergic reactions	can affect	digestive system
digestive system	includes	intestines
food allergies	may cause	vomiting
vomiting	is a	digestive response
allergic reactions	can cause	hypotension
hypotension	is treated with	vasopressors
norepinephrine	is a	vasopressor
allergic reactions	may lead to	shock
shock	requires	fluid resuscitation
saline solution	is used for	fluid resuscitation
allergic reactions	are monitored with	vital signs
vital signs	include	blood pressure
allergic reactions	can cause	tachycardia
tachycardia	is treated with	beta blockers
propranolol	is a	beta blocker
allergic reactions	may involve	mast cells
mast cells	release	histamine
allergic reactions	can trigger	cytokine release
cytokines	promote	inflammation
allergic reactions	are assessed with	IgE tests
IgE antibodies	bind to	allergens
allergic reactions	can be chronic	in atopic dermatitis
atopic dermatitis	is exacerbated by	scratching
scratching	damages	skin barrier
allergic reactions	may follow	insect stings
bee stings	can trigger	anaphylaxis
allergic reactions	are documented in	medical history
medical history	guides	treatment plans
allergic reactions	can be seasonal	in hay fever
hay fever	is caused by	pollen exposure
allergic reactions	may worsen	sinusitis
sinusitis	involves	nasal inflammation
allergic reactions	can lead to	conjunctivitis
conjunctivitis	causes	red eyes
allergic reactions	are prevented by	HEPA filters
HEPA filters	trap	airborne allergens
allergic reactions	may coexist with	autoimmune diseases
autoimmune diseases	involve	immune dysregulation
allergic reactions	can be exacerbated by	stress
stress	activates	mast cells
allergic reactions	are researched in	immunology
immunology	studies	immune responses
allergic reactions	can be delayed	in contact dermatitis
contact dermatitis	results from	skin contact
allergic reactions	may require	ICU admission
ICU admission	ensures	close monitoring
allergic reactions	can be fatal	without treatment
fatal outcomes	are prevented by	prompt intervention
allergic reactions	are reported to	allergy registries
allergy registries	track	allergen prevalence
allergic reactions	can be occupationally related
occupational allergens	include	latex
allergic reactions	may recur	upon re-exposure
re-exposure	increases	symptom severity
allergic reactions	are influenced by	genetics
genetics	determine	immune reactivity
allergic reactions	can be tested with	patch tests
patch tests	identify	contact allergens
allergic reactions	may involve	eosinophils
eosinophils	contribute to	inflammation
