varicose veins	affects	lower extremity
varicose veins	is caused by	venous insufficiency
venous insufficiency	results from	valve dysfunction
valve dysfunction	leads to	blood pooling
blood pooling	causes	vein dilation
vein dilation	manifests as	varicose veins
varicose veins	may cause	pain
varicose veins	may cause	swelling
varicose veins	may cause	skin changes
skin changes	include	hyperpigmentation
hyperpigmentation	results from	hemosiderin deposition
varicose veins	may progress to	venous ulcers
venous ulcers	require	wound care
wound care	involves	compression therapy
compression therapy	uses	compression stockings
compression stockings	improve	venous return
venous return	prevents	blood stasis
blood stasis	increases risk of	deep vein thrombosis
deep vein thrombosis	may lead to	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	is a	life-threatening condition
varicose veins	is diagnosed with	duplex ultrasound
duplex ultrasound	assesses	venous reflux
venous reflux	indicates	valve incompetence
valve incompetence	requires	treatment
varicose veins	is treated with	sclerotherapy
sclerotherapy	involves	injection therapy
injection therapy	uses	sclerosant
sclerosant	causes	vein fibrosis
vein fibrosis	leads to	vein closure
varicose veins	is treated with	endovenous ablation
endovenous ablation	uses	laser energy
laser energy	generates	thermal damage
thermal damage	results in	vein closure
varicose veins	may require	surgical stripping
surgical stripping	removes	diseased veins
diseased veins	are replaced by	collateral circulation
collateral circulation	maintains	venous drainage
venous drainage	prevents	venous hypertension
venous hypertension	exacerbates	varicose veins
varicose veins	is associated with	obesity
obesity	increases	intra-abdominal pressure
intra-abdominal pressure	impairs	venous return
varicose veins	is associated with	pregnancy
pregnancy	causes	hormonal changes
hormonal changes	relax	vein walls
vein wall relaxation	promotes	vein dilation
varicose veins	is associated with	prolonged standing
prolonged standing	increases	venous pressure
venous pressure	stretches	vein walls
varicose veins	is prevented by	leg elevation
leg elevation	reduces	venous pressure
varicose veins	is prevented by	exercise
exercise	improves	calf muscle pump
calf muscle pump	assists	venous return
varicose veins	may cause	superficial thrombophlebitis
superficial thrombophlebitis	presents with	tender veins
tender veins	may indicate	inflammation
inflammation	requires	anti-inflammatory drugs
anti-inflammatory drugs	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	reduce	pain
varicose veins	may lead to	bleeding
bleeding	requires	pressure dressing
pressure dressing	controls	hemorrhage
varicose veins	affects	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	questionnaires
questionnaires	assess	symptom severity
symptom severity	guides	treatment decisions
varicose veins	is more common in	females
females	have	hormonal influences
hormonal influences	affect	vein elasticity
vein elasticity	determines	vein resilience
varicose veins	has genetic predisposition
genetic predisposition	involves	connective tissue disorders
connective tissue disorders	weaken	vein structure
varicose veins	is associated with	aging
aging	reduces	vein elasticity
varicose veins	may recur after	treatment
recurrence	necessitates	re-intervention
varicose veins	is classified by	CEAP classification
CEAP classification	grades	venous disease
venous disease	progresses through	stages
varicose veins	may coexist with	spider veins
spider veins	are	smaller varicosities
varicose veins	increases risk of	cellulitis
cellulitis	requires	antibiotic treatment
antibiotic treatment	targets	bacterial infection
varicose veins	is managed by	vascular specialists
vascular specialists	perform	venous procedures
venous procedures	have	complication risks
complication risks	include	nerve injury
nerve injury	causes	sensory changes
sensory changes	may be	temporary
varicose veins	treatment	has success rates
success rates	depend on	procedure type
procedure type	varies by	disease severity
varicose veins	research	explores new treatments
new treatments	aim for	minimal invasiveness
minimal invasiveness	reduces	recovery time
recovery time	affects	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	determines	treatment adoption
