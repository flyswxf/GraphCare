aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	is a	vascular disorder
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	may cause	limb ischemia
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	is treated with	anticoagulants
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	may lead to	tissue necrosis
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	is diagnosed by	Doppler ultrasound
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	is associated with	atrial fibrillation
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	may require	thrombectomy
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	is a complication of	atherosclerosis
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	is managed with	heparin
aortic and peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis	increases risk of	amputation
anticoagulants	prevent	blood clots
heparin	is a	anticoagulant
warfarin	is a	anticoagulant
DOACs	are	anticoagulants
Doppler ultrasound	detects	blood flow obstruction
limb ischemia	may result in	gangrene
tissue necrosis	requires	debridement
atrial fibrillation	increases risk of	embolism
thrombectomy	removes	blood clots
atherosclerosis	causes	arterial narrowing
arterial narrowing	predisposes to	thrombosis
amputation	is a treatment for	gangrene
blood clots	can occlude	arteries
embolism	is a	traveling blood clot
thrombosis	is a	stationary blood clot
vascular disorder	affects	circulation
circulation impairment	causes	pain
pain	is a symptom of	limb ischemia
debridement	removes	dead tissue
gangrene	is caused by	oxygen deprivation
oxygen deprivation	results from	artery blockage
artery blockage	is seen in	aortic thrombosis
aortic thrombosis	is a type of	arterial thrombosis
peripheral arterial thrombosis	affects	limbs
limbs	are supplied by	peripheral arteries
peripheral arteries	can develop	plaques
plaques	consist of	cholesterol
cholesterol	contributes to	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	is a	chronic condition
chronic condition	requires	long-term management
long-term management	includes	medication
medication	aims to	prevent complications
complications	include	stroke
stroke	can result from	cerebral embolism
cerebral embolism	originates from	aortic arch
aortic arch	is a site for	thrombus formation
thrombus formation	is triggered by	endothelial injury
endothelial injury	is caused by	hypertension
hypertension	is a risk factor for	atherosclerosis
risk factors	include	diabetes
diabetes	accelerates	vascular damage
vascular damage	promotes	clot formation
clot formation	is regulated by	coagulation factors
coagulation factors	are targeted by	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	have side effects like	bleeding
bleeding	is a complication of	over-anticoagulation
over-anticoagulation	is monitored by	INR
INR	measures	blood clotting time
blood clotting time	is prolonged by	warfarin
warfarin	requires	dietary restrictions
dietary restrictions	involve	vitamin K
vitamin K	affects	clotting factors
clotting factors	are produced in	liver
liver disease	impairs	clotting factor production
clotting factor deficiency	increases	bleeding risk
bleeding risk	is assessed by	bleeding scores
bleeding scores	guide	treatment decisions
treatment decisions	consider	patient comorbidities
patient comorbidities	include	heart disease
heart disease	is linked to	arterial embolism
arterial embolism	can originate from	heart valves
heart valves	can develop	vegetations
vegetations	are seen in	endocarditis
endocarditis	is an infection of	heart lining
heart lining	can harbor	bacteria
bacteria	cause	infective endocarditis
infective endocarditis	leads to	septic embolism
septic embolism	causes	infected infarcts
infected infarcts	require	antibiotics
antibiotics	treat	bacterial infections
bacterial infections	can complicate	vascular procedures
vascular procedures	include	angioplasty
angioplasty	opens	blocked arteries
blocked arteries	may need	stents
stents	maintain	artery patency
artery patency	prevents	re-thrombosis
re-thrombosis	is reduced by	antiplatelets
antiplatelets	include	aspirin
aspirin	inhibits	platelet aggregation
platelet aggregation	forms	clots
clots	are dissolved by	thrombolytics
thrombolytics	are used in	acute thrombosis
acute thrombosis	presents with	sudden pain
sudden pain	prompts	emergency care
emergency care	involves	vascular imaging
vascular imaging	includes	CT angiography
CT angiography	visualizes	arterial blockages
arterial blockages	determine	treatment approach
treatment approach	combines	medication and procedures
medication and procedures	aim to	restore blood flow
