ENTITY 1	RELATIONSHIP	ENTITY 2
TURP	is a	surgical procedure
TURP	treats	benign prostatic hyperplasia
TURP	performed via	urethra
TURP	removes	prostate tissue
TURP	requires	general anesthesia
prostate	located near	bladder
prostate	surrounds	urethra
enlarged prostate	causes	urinary obstruction
urinary obstruction	leads to	hydronephrosis
hydronephrosis	damages	kidneys
TURP	indicated for	lower urinary tract symptoms
lower urinary tract symptoms	include	urinary frequency
lower urinary tract symptoms	include	nocturia
lower urinary tract symptoms	include	weak stream
TURP	contraindicated in	prostate cancer
TURP	uses	resectoscope
resectoscope	contains	wire loop
wire loop	cuts	prostate tissue
TURP	requires	irrigation fluid
irrigation fluid	prevents	bleeding
TURP	may cause	bleeding
TURP	may cause	infection
TURP syndrome	is a complication of	TURP
TURP syndrome	involves	hyponatremia
hyponatremia	affects	brain function
post-TURP	requires	catheterization
catheterization	prevents	urinary retention
post-TURP	monitors for	hematuria
hematuria	indicates	bleeding
post-TURP	restricts	heavy lifting
alpha blockers	alternative to	TURP
5-alpha reductase inhibitors	shrink	prostate
antibiotics	prevent	post-TURP infection
analgesics	manage	post-TURP pain
diuretics	contraindicated in	TURP syndrome
patient age	affects	TURP outcomes
prostate size	determines	resection time
resection time	correlates with	complications
preoperative PSA	predicts	cancer risk
obesity	increases	surgical risks
laser prostatectomy	alternative to	TURP
open prostatectomy	for large	prostates
Rezum therapy	uses	steam injection
UroLift	preserves	ejaculation
TUMT	is non-invasive	BPH treatment
BPH	involves	stromal hyperplasia
stromal hyperplasia	increases	prostate volume
prostate volume	measured by	ultrasound
urinary retention	requires	emergency catheter
chronic retention	damages	bladder
TURP	improves	urinary flow
improved flow	reduces	residual urine
residual urine	promotes	UTIs
UTIs	cause	dysuria
dysuria	decreases	quality of life
spinal anesthesia	option for	TURP
general anesthesia	risks include	hypotension
hypotension	exacerbates	TURP syndrome
anesthesia	requires	preoperative evaluation
elderly patients	sensitive to	anesthetics
uroflowmetry	assesses	voiding function
cystoscopy	evaluates	urethral stricture
TRUS	measures	prostate size
PSA test	screens for	cancer
postvoid residual	indicates	obstruction
TURP	may cause	retrograde ejaculation
retrograde ejaculation	affects	fertility
TURP	rarely causes	incontinence
incontinence	managed by	pelvic exercises
urethral stricture	late complication of	TURP
BPH	prevalence increases with	age
men over 50	commonly develop	BPH
family history	influences	BPH risk
diabetes	correlates with	BPH severity
metabolic syndrome	worsens	LUTS
bipolar TURP	reduces	bleeding risk
bipolar TURP	uses	saline irrigation
laser enucleation	replaces	traditional TURP
robotic surgery	not used for	TURP
minimally invasive techniques	decrease	hospital stay
nurses	monitor for	clot retention
clot retention	treated with	bladder irrigation
nurses	educate about	fluid intake
increased fluids	prevent	catheter blockage
nurses	assess for	signs of sepsis
TURP	costs less than	laser surgery
hospital stay	affects	treatment cost
complications	increase	healthcare costs
day-case TURP	reduces	expenses
insurance coverage	varies for	BPH treatments
successful TURP	improves	sleep quality
nocturia reduction	enhances	daytime function
urinary symptoms	correlate with	depression
symptom relief	increases	physical activity
sexual function	may change after	TURP
GreenLight laser	comparable to	TURP
Rezum	preserves	sexual function
Aquablation	robot-assisted	waterjet resection
prostate artery embolization	emerging	BPH treatment
TURP	remains gold standard for	moderate BPH
