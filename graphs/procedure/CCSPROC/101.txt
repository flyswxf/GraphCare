transurethral excision	is a	surgical procedure
transurethral excision	treats	urinary obstruction
urinary obstruction	caused by	benign prostatic hyperplasia
benign prostatic hyperplasia	affects	prostate
prostate	part of	male reproductive system
urinary obstruction	symptom	urinary retention
urinary retention	leads to	bladder distension
bladder distension	causes	discomfort
discomfort	measured by	pain scale
pain scale	used in	patient assessment
patient assessment	involves	medical history
medical history	includes	comorbidities
comorbidities	affect	treatment outcome
treatment outcome	evaluated by	follow-up
follow-up	may require	imaging
imaging	includes	ultrasound
ultrasound	detects	hydronephrosis
hydronephrosis	complication of	urinary obstruction
urinary obstruction	may lead to	kidney damage
kidney damage	assessed by	creatinine levels
creatinine levels	indicate	renal function
renal function	monitored by	blood tests
blood tests	include	electrolyte panel
electrolyte panel	detects	hyperkalemia
hyperkalemia	risk factor for	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	managed by	cardiology
cardiology	specializes in	heart conditions
heart conditions	contraindication for	surgery
surgery	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	types include	general anesthesia
general anesthesia	administered by	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	evaluates	patient fitness
patient fitness	determines	surgical risk
surgical risk	includes	bleeding
bleeding	controlled by	hemostasis
hemostasis	achieved via	electrocautery
electrocautery	used during	transurethral resection
transurethral resection	alternative to	transurethral excision
transurethral resection	treats	bladder tumors
bladder tumors	diagnosed by	cystoscopy
cystoscopy	involves	urethral insertion
urethral insertion	may cause	infection
infection	prevented by	antibiotics
antibiotics	prescribed based on	culture
culture	identifies	bacteria
bacteria	cause	UTI
UTI	symptom	dysuria
dysuria	relieved by	analgesics
analgesics	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	contraindicated in	renal impairment
renal impairment	complication of	chronic obstruction
chronic obstruction	managed by	catheterization
catheterization	types include	Foley catheter
Foley catheter	inserted via	urethra
urethra	part of	urinary tract
urinary tract	includes	kidneys
kidneys	produce	urine
urine	transported via	ureters
ureters	connect to	bladder
bladder	stores	urine
urine	expelled via	micturition
micturition	controlled by	sphincters
sphincters	innervated by	pudendal nerve
pudendal nerve	branches from	sacral plexus
sacral plexus	supplies	pelvic organs
pelvic organs	include	prostate
prostate	enlarges with	age
age	risk factor for	BPH
BPH	treated by	alpha-blockers
alpha-blockers	relax	smooth muscle
smooth muscle	found in	bladder neck
bladder neck	obstructed by	enlarged prostate
enlarged prostate	measured by	PSA
PSA	screened via	blood test
blood test	ordered by	urologist
urologist	specializes in	urinary system
urinary system	diseases include	nephrolithiasis
nephrolithiasis	causes	renal colic
renal colic	treated by	analgesics
analgesics	administered via	IV
IV	delivers	fluids
fluids	prevent	dehydration
dehydration	exacerbates	renal failure
renal failure	requires	dialysis
dialysis	replaces	kidney function
kidney function	critical for	homeostasis
homeostasis	regulated by	hormones
hormones	include	ADH
ADH	secreted by	pituitary
pituitary	located in	brain
brain	controls	micturition reflex
micturition reflex	impaired in	neurogenic bladder
neurogenic bladder	caused by	spinal injury
spinal injury	assessed by	MRI
MRI	visualizes	soft tissue
soft tissue	includes	prostate
prostate	examined via	DRE
DRE	performed by	physician
physician	refers to	specialist
specialist	may recommend	surgery
