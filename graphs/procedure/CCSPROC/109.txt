urethral procedure	is a	medical procedure
urethral procedure	performed on	urethra
urethral dilation	is a type of	urethral procedure
urethrotomy	is a type of	urethral procedure
urethroplasty	is a type of	urethral procedure
catheterization	is a type of	urethral procedure
cystoscopy	involves	urethra
urethral dilation	treats	urethral stricture
urethrotomy	treats	urethral stricture
urethroplasty	repairs	urethral injury
catheterization	relieves	urinary retention
cystoscopy	diagnoses	urethral obstruction
urethral procedure	requires	anesthesia
urethral dilation	uses	dilators
urethrotomy	uses	surgical knife
urethroplasty	uses	graft tissue
catheterization	uses	urinary catheter
cystoscopy	uses	endoscope
urethral stricture	causes	urinary obstruction
urinary obstruction	leads to	hydronephrosis
hydronephrosis	affects	kidneys
urethral injury	results from	trauma
trauma	includes	pelvic fracture
pelvic fracture	may cause	urethral rupture
urinary retention	indicates	bladder dysfunction
bladder dysfunction	associates with	prostate enlargement
prostate enlargement	causes	BPH
BPH	requires	medical management
medical management	includes	alpha-blockers
alpha-blockers	relax	prostate muscles
urethral procedure	prevents	UTIs
UTIs	result from	bacterial infection
bacterial infection	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	Escherichia coli
Escherichia coli	commonly causes	urinary infections
urethral stricture	increases risk	catheter complications
catheter complications	include	urethral trauma
urethral trauma	necessitates	surgical repair
surgical repair	involves	urethroplasty
urethroplasty	has risk	recurrence
recurrence	requires	repeat surgery
repeat surgery	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	impact	patient burden
patient burden	affects	quality of life
quality of life	improves with	successful treatment
successful treatment	depends on	surgeon skill
surgeon skill	enhanced by	specialized training
specialized training	includes	urology residency
urology residency	educates	future urologists
urologists	perform	urethral procedures
urethral procedure	may cause	bleeding
bleeding	managed with	cauterization
cauterization	uses	electrocautery
electrocautery	minimizes	blood loss
blood loss	affects	postoperative recovery
postoperative recovery	involves	pain management
pain management	includes	analgesics
analgesics	reduce	patient discomfort
patient discomfort	decreases	mobility
mobility	improves with	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	speeds up	healing
healing	depends on	patient health
patient health	influenced by	nutrition
nutrition	supports	tissue repair
tissue repair	requires	protein intake
protein intake	aids	wound healing
wound healing	prevents	infection
infection	delays	recovery time
recovery time	varies by	procedure complexity
procedure complexity	depends on	stricture length
stricture length	measured via	imaging
imaging	includes	urethrogram
urethrogram	visualizes	urethral narrowing
urethral narrowing	confirms	stricture diagnosis
stricture diagnosis	leads to	treatment planning
treatment planning	considers	patient age
patient age	affects	anesthesia risk
anesthesia risk	assessed by	pre-op evaluation
pre-op evaluation	includes	medical history
medical history	identifies	comorbidities
comorbidities	complicate	surgical outcomes
surgical outcomes	improve with	minimally invasive techniques
minimally invasive techniques	reduce	hospital stay
hospital stay	increases	infection risk
infection risk	lowered by	sterile technique
sterile technique	prevents	surgical site infections
surgical site infections	require	antibiotic therapy
antibiotic therapy	combats	resistant bacteria
resistant bacteria	challenge	infection control
infection control	involves	hygiene protocols
hygiene protocols	enforced in	operating rooms
operating rooms	maintain	sterile environment
sterile environment	reduces	contamination
contamination	leads to	postoperative complications
postoperative complications	monitored via	follow-up visits
follow-up visits	assess	treatment success
treatment success	measured by	symptom relief
symptom relief	improves	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	reflects	healthcare quality
healthcare quality	optimized by	evidence-based practices
