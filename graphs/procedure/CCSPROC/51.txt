carotid endarterectomy	is a type of	endarterectomy
carotid endarterectomy	treats	carotid stenosis
carotid endarterectomy	prevents	stroke
carotid endarterectomy	removes	plaque
carotid artery	is a	vessel of head and neck
carotid artery	supplies blood to	brain
carotid artery stenosis	causes	reduced blood flow
carotid artery stenosis	increases risk of	transient ischemic attack
endarterectomy	requires	anesthesia
endarterectomy	has risk of	bleeding
endarterectomy	has risk of	infection
endarterectomy	has risk of	nerve injury
endarterectomy	requires	preoperative imaging
Doppler ultrasound	evaluates	carotid stenosis
CT angiography	evaluates	carotid stenosis
MR angiography	evaluates	carotid stenosis
endarterectomy	alternative to	stenting
carotid stenting	is less invasive than	endarterectomy
endarterectomy	has better long-term results than	stenting
endarterectomy	requires	hospital stay
endarterectomy	requires	postoperative monitoring
endarterectomy	followed by	antiplatelet therapy
aspirin	is a	antiplatelet drug
clopidogrel	is a	antiplatelet drug
endarterectomy	reduces risk of	ischemic stroke
stroke	is a	neurological emergency
stroke	causes	disability
stroke	requires	rehabilitation
endarterectomy	contraindicated in	complete carotid occlusion
endarterectomy	contraindicated in	unstable angina
endarterectomy	contraindicated in	recent myocardial infarction
endarterectomy	improves	cerebral perfusion
cerebral perfusion	affects	cognitive function
carotid artery	divides into	internal carotid artery
carotid artery	divides into	external carotid artery
internal carotid artery	supplies	anterior brain
external carotid artery	supplies	face and scalp
endarterectomy	most commonly performed on	internal carotid artery
endarterectomy	uses	vascular clamp
endarterectomy	may use	shunt
shunt	maintains	cerebral blood flow
endarterectomy	involves	arteriotomy
arteriotomy	is	artery incision
endarterectomy	closes with	sutures
endarterectomy	sometimes uses	patch angioplasty
patch angioplasty	reduces	restenosis
restenosis	is	recurrent narrowing
endarterectomy	has	success rate
success rate	depends on	surgeon experience
surgeon experience	affects	complication rate
complication rate	influences	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	measured by	stroke prevention
stroke prevention	improves	quality of life
quality of life	depends on	neurological function
neurological function	assessed by	NIH stroke scale
NIH stroke scale	measures	stroke severity
endarterectomy	benefits outweigh risks in	symptomatic patients
symptomatic patients	have	transient ischemic attacks
transient ischemic attacks	are	warning signs
endarterectomy	may benefit	selected asymptomatic patients
asymptomatic patients	have	carotid bruits
carotid bruits	indicate	turbulent flow
turbulent flow	suggests	stenosis
endarterectomy	requires	informed consent
informed consent	explains	procedure risks
procedure risks	include	cranial nerve injury
cranial nerve injury	causes	hoarseness
cranial nerve injury	causes	swallowing difficulty
endarterectomy	followed by	blood pressure control
blood pressure control	prevents	hyperperfusion syndrome
hyperperfusion syndrome	causes	cerebral edema
cerebral edema	increases	intracranial pressure
intracranial pressure	affects	brain function
endarterectomy	monitored with	neurological checks
neurological checks	detect	stroke symptoms
stroke symptoms	include	weakness
stroke symptoms	include	speech difficulty
endarterectomy	contraindicated in	dementia
dementia	affects	decision-making capacity
endarterectomy	requires	vascular surgeon
vascular surgeon	specializes in	artery procedures
endarterectomy	sometimes performed with	cardiac surgery
cardiac surgery	includes	coronary artery bypass
coronary artery bypass	treats	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	is	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	affects	multiple arteries
endarterectomy	has	recovery period
recovery period	involves	activity limitations
activity limitations	prevent	wound complications
wound complications	include	hematoma
hematoma	may require	reoperation
endarterectomy	indications based on	stenosis percentage
stenosis percentage	measured by	imaging studies
imaging studies	guide	treatment decisions
treatment decisions	consider	patient comorbidities
patient comorbidities	affect	surgical risk
surgical risk	influences	procedure choice
procedure choice	determines	health outcomes
