cystic fibrosis	affects	lungs
lungs	damaged by	smoking
smoking	causes	peptic ulcers
peptic ulcers	treated by	H. pylori eradication
H. pylori eradication	uses	antibiotic therapy
antibiotic therapy	combines	clarithromycin
clarithromycin	interacts with	statins
statins	lower	cholesterol
high cholesterol	leads to	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	causes	ischemic colitis
ischemic colitis	diagnosed by	colonoscopy
colonoscopy	screens for	diverticulosis
diverticulosis	may develop	diverticulitis
diverticulitis	treated by	bowel rest
bowel rest	involves	IV fluids

dehydration	worsens	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	corrected by	potassium chloride
potassium chloride	regulates	heart rhythm
abnormal heart rhythm	monitored by	ECG
ECG	detects	atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation	increases risk	stroke
stroke	prevented by	anticoagulants
anticoagulants	include	warfarin
warfarin	requires	INR monitoring
INR monitoring	ensures	proper dosing

nosocomial infections	resistant to	antibiotics
antibiotic resistance	combated by	antimicrobial stewardship
antimicrobial stewardship	reduces	superbugs
superbugs	include	MRSA
MRSA	treated by	vancomycin
vancomycin	monitored by	trough levels
trough levels	ensure	therapeutic range
therapeutic range	avoids	nephrotoxicity
nephrotoxicity	affects	kidney function
kidney function	assessed by	creatinine levels
