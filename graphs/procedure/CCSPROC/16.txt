repair of retinal tear	is a	surgical procedure
repair of retinal tear	treats	retinal detachment
retinal detachment	is caused by	retinal tear
retinal tear	caused by	vitreous traction
vitreous traction	occurs in	posterior vitreous detachment
posterior vitreous detachment	related to	aging
retinal detachment	requires	urgent treatment
repair of retinal tear	prevents	vision loss
vision loss	measured by	visual acuity
visual acuity	assessed by	eye exam
eye exam	includes	fundoscopy
fundoscopy	detects	retinal abnormalities
retinal abnormalities	include	retinal tears
retinal tears	lead to	retinal detachment
retinal detachment	classified as	rhegmatogenous
rhegmatogenous detachment	most common type	retinal detachment
repair of retinal tear	performed by	vitreoretinal surgeon
vitreoretinal surgeon	specializes in	retinal diseases
retinal diseases	include	diabetic retinopathy
diabetic retinopathy	causes	vision impairment
vision impairment	affects	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	questionnaires
repair of retinal tear	involves	laser photocoagulation
laser photocoagulation	creates	scar tissue
scar tissue	seals	retinal tear
retinal tear	located in	peripheral retina
peripheral retina	examined with	scleral depression
scleral depression	requires	specialized equipment
specialized equipment	includes	indirect ophthalmoscope
indirect ophthalmoscope	provides	wide-field view
wide-field view	helps detect	retinal breaks
retinal breaks	include	retinal tears
repair of retinal tear	alternative to	pneumatic retinopexy
pneumatic retinopexy	uses	gas bubble
gas bubble	pushes	retina
retina	reattaches to	retinal pigment epithelium
retinal pigment epithelium	nourishes	photoreceptors
photoreceptors	convert	light to signals
light to signals	transmitted via	optic nerve
optic nerve	carries	visual information
visual information	processed in	visual cortex
visual cortex	located in	occipital lobe
repair of retinal tear	may require	vitrectomy
vitrectomy	removes	vitreous humor
vitreous humor	replaced by	saline solution
saline solution	maintains	intraocular pressure
intraocular pressure	measured by	tonometry
tonometry	important for	glaucoma screening
glaucoma	damages	optic nerve
optic nerve damage	causes	vision loss
vision loss	prevented by	early detection
early detection	achieved through	regular eye exams
regular eye exams	recommended for	high-risk patients
high-risk patients	include	myopes
myopes	have	elongated eyeballs
elongated eyeballs	predispose to	retinal thinning
retinal thinning	increases risk	retinal tears
retinal tears	may occur after	eye trauma
eye trauma	includes	blunt injury
blunt injury	causes	sudden vision changes
sudden vision changes	require	emergency care
emergency care	provided in	ophthalmology department
ophthalmology department	staffed by	eye specialists
eye specialists	include	ophthalmologists
ophthalmologists	perform	retinal surgeries
retinal surgeries	require	operating microscope
operating microscope	provides	magnification
magnification	enables	precise maneuvers
precise maneuvers	necessary for	delicate tissues
delicate tissues	include	retinal layers
retinal layers	consist of	neural retina
neural retina	contains	ganglion cells
ganglion cells	form	optic nerve fibers
repair of retinal tear	may involve	cryotherapy
cryotherapy	uses	freezing probe
freezing probe	creates	adhesion
adhesion	secures	retina
retina	composed of	sensory tissue
sensory tissue	processes	visual stimuli
visual stimuli	interpreted by	brain
brain	coordinates	visual perception
visual perception	affected by	retinal damage
retinal damage	assessed with	OCT
OCT	provides	cross-sectional images
cross-sectional images	show	retinal layers
retinal layers	evaluated for	abnormalities
abnormalities	include	subretinal fluid
subretinal fluid	characteristic of	detachment
detachment	treated with	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	ensures	patient comfort
patient comfort	important for	cooperation
cooperation	necessary for	successful surgery
successful surgery	restores	vision
vision	depends on	retinal integrity
retinal integrity	maintained by	prompt treatment
prompt treatment	reduces	complications
complications	include	proliferative vitreoretinopathy
proliferative vitreoretinopathy	causes	retinal scarring
retinal scarring	leads to	visual impairment
