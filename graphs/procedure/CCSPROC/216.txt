respiratory intubation	is a	medical procedure
mechanical ventilation	is a	life support technique
respiratory intubation	enables	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	treats	respiratory failure
respiratory intubation	requires	sedation
mechanical ventilation	requires	ventilator
ventilator	delivers	oxygen
oxygen	supports	cellular respiration
respiratory failure	caused by	pneumonia
pneumonia	treated with	antibiotics
respiratory intubation	performed in	ICU
ICU	has	critical care team
critical care team	includes	intensivists
intensivists	prescribe	ventilator settings
ventilator settings	include	PEEP
PEEP	prevents	alveolar collapse
alveolar collapse	causes	hypoxemia
hypoxemia	leads to	organ failure
organ failure	increases	mortality risk
mechanical ventilation	causes	ventilator-induced lung injury
ventilator-induced lung injury	requires	protective ventilation
protective ventilation	uses	low tidal volumes
low tidal volumes	reduce	barotrauma
barotrauma	causes	pneumothorax
pneumothorax	treated with	chest tube
respiratory intubation	requires	endotracheal tube
endotracheal tube	has	cuff
cuff	prevents	aspiration
aspiration	causes	pneumonia
mechanical ventilation	associated with	ventilator-associated pneumonia
ventilator-associated pneumonia	increases	ICU stay
prolonged ICU stay	raises	healthcare costs
respiratory intubation	can lead to	laryngeal injury
laryngeal injury	causes	voice changes
voice changes	assessed by	speech therapy
speech therapy	helps	post-extubation recovery
mechanical ventilation	requires	arterial blood gas monitoring
arterial blood gas	measures	oxygenation
oxygenation	determines	ventilator adjustments
respiratory intubation	contraindicated in	severe facial trauma
severe facial trauma	may require	tracheostomy
tracheostomy	alternative to	prolonged intubation
prolonged intubation	increases	infection risk
infection risk	reduced by	sterile technique
sterile technique	includes	hand hygiene
hand hygiene	prevents	nosocomial infections
mechanical ventilation	can cause	diaphragm dysfunction
diaphragm dysfunction	leads to	weaning failure
weaning failure	prolongs	ventilator dependence
ventilator dependence	requires	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	improves	respiratory muscle strength
respiratory muscle strength	assessed by	spirometry
spirometry	measures	lung function
lung function	affected by	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	exacerbation requires	non-invasive ventilation
non-invasive ventilation	alternative to	intubation
respiratory intubation	requires	rapid sequence induction
rapid sequence induction	uses	neuromuscular blockers
neuromuscular blockers	cause	paralysis
paralysis	requires	continuous monitoring
continuous monitoring	includes	pulse oximetry
pulse oximetry	measures	oxygen saturation
oxygen saturation	indicates	respiratory status
respiratory status	deteriorates in	ARDS
ARDS	managed with	prone positioning
prone positioning	improves	oxygenation
mechanical ventilation	can induce	ventilator dyssynchrony
ventilator dyssynchrony	causes	patient discomfort
patient discomfort	requires	sedation adjustment
sedation adjustment	aims for	RASS score
RASS score	guides	analgesia
analgesia	reduces	pain
pain	increases	sympathetic response
sympathetic response	elevates	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored via	arterial line
arterial line	allows	blood sampling
respiratory intubation	complications include	esophageal intubation
esophageal intubation	detected by	capnography
capnography	confirms	tracheal placement
mechanical ventilation	modes include	pressure control
pressure control	maintains	airway pressure
airway pressure	affects	cardiac output
cardiac output	determines	tissue perfusion
tissue perfusion	impacts	organ function
organ function	assessed by	lab tests
lab tests	include	lactate levels
lactate levels	indicate	tissue hypoxia
tissue hypoxia	corrected by	oxygen therapy
oxygen therapy	delivered via	nasal cannula
nasal cannula	used for	oxygen supplementation
respiratory intubation	requires	preoxygenation
preoxygenation	increases	oxygen reserves
oxygen reserves	prolong	safe apnea time
safe apnea time	crucial for	emergency intubation
emergency intubation	performed in	cardiac arrest
cardiac arrest	managed with	CPR
CPR	includes	chest compressions
chest compressions	maintain	circulation
circulation	delivers	oxygenated blood
oxygenated blood	sustains	vital organs
