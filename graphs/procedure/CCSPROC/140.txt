repair of obstetric laceration	is a	surgical procedure
repair of obstetric laceration	treats	perineal tear
perineal tear	caused by	childbirth
childbirth	associated with	episiotomy
episiotomy	increases risk of	severe laceration
severe laceration	requires	suture repair
suture repair	uses	absorbable sutures
absorbable sutures	reduce need for	removal procedure
removal procedure	prevents	infection
infection	treated with	antibiotics
repair of obstetric laceration	performed by	obstetrician
obstetrician	monitors	postpartum recovery
postpartum recovery	involves	pain management
pain management	includes	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	contraindicated for	breastfeeding mothers
breastfeeding mothers	need	alternative analgesics
alternative analgesics	include	acetaminophen
acetaminophen	has risk of	liver damage
liver damage	screened by	liver function tests
liver function tests	detect	elevated enzymes
obstetric laceration	classified by	degree
fourth-degree tear	involves	anal sphincter
anal sphincter injury	leads to	fecal incontinence
fecal incontinence	assessed by	endoanal ultrasound
endoanal ultrasound	evaluates	sphincter defects
sphincter defects	repaired by	overlapping technique
overlapping technique	improves	continence outcomes
continence outcomes	measured by	Wexner score
Wexner score	predicts	quality of life
quality of life	impacts	postpartum depression
repair timing	affects	healing process
immediate repair	prevents	excessive bleeding
excessive bleeding	causes	anemia
anemia	treated with	iron supplementation
iron supplementation	causes	constipation
constipation	worsens	perineal pain
perineal pain	managed with	sitz baths
sitz baths	promote	wound healing
wound healing	delayed by	infection
infection	prevented by	perineal hygiene
obstetric laceration	associated with	instrumental delivery
forceps delivery	increases risk of	severe tears
severe tears	require	operative repair
operative repair	performed under	regional anesthesia
regional anesthesia	includes	spinal block
spinal block	may cause	post-dural headache
post-dural headache	treated with	blood patch
blood patch	requires	specialized equipment
specialized equipment	available in	tertiary hospitals
tertiary hospitals	have	urogynecology specialists
prolonged second stage	risk factor for	lacerations
nulliparity	increases risk of	prolonged labor
prolonged labor	leads to	fetal distress
fetal distress	indicated by	abnormal CTG
abnormal CTG	necessitates	emergency delivery
emergency delivery	increases risk of	trauma
birth trauma	includes	nerve damage
nerve damage	causes	perineal numbness
perineal numbness	affects	sexual function
sexual function	recovers within	6 months
repair complications	include	dehiscence
dehiscence	requires	reoperation
reoperation	increases risk of	scarring
scarring	causes	dyspareunia
dyspareunia	treated with	pelvic floor therapy
pelvic floor therapy	improves	muscle tone
muscle tone	prevents	prolapse
prolapse	indicated by	bulge sensation
bulge sensation	evaluated by	POP-Q exam
POP-Q exam	quantifies	descent severity
maternal age >35	risk factor for	lacerations
macrosomia	causes	tissue overstretching
tissue overstretching	results in	deep tears
deep tears	involve	levator ani
levator ani injury	leads to	pelvic instability
pelvic instability	causes	chronic pain
chronic pain	managed with	multidisciplinary approach
multidisciplinary approach	includes	physiotherapy
physiotherapy	teaches	proper lifting techniques
proper lifting techniques	prevent	re-injury
Asian ethnicity	higher risk of	severe tears
genetic factors	influence	collagen quality
collagen quality	affects	tissue elasticity
tissue elasticity	reduced in	smokers
smoking	delays	wound healing
wound healing	monitored through	REEDA scale
REEDA scale	assesses	redness
redness	indicates	inflammation
inflammation	controlled with	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	suppress	immune response
antenatal perineal massage	prevents	severe tears
warm compresses	reduce	tear severity
upright positioning	decreases	perineal trauma
perineal trauma	measured by	tear classification
midline episiotomy	increases	extension risk
mediolateral episiotomy	protects	anal sphincter
suture material choice	affects	tissue reaction
delayed absorbable sutures	reduce	dehiscence rates
antibiotic prophylaxis	prevents	surgical site infection
follow-up schedule	ensures	proper healing
