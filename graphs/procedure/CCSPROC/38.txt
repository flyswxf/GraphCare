bronchoscopy	is a	diagnostic procedure
bronchoscopy	examines	lung airways
bronchoscopy	can detect	lung cancer
bronchoscopy	can diagnose	bronchitis
bronchoscopy	helps identify	infections
bronchoscopy	may involve	biopsy
biopsy	collects	tissue samples
biopsy	confirms	malignancies
biopsy	differentiates	benign lesions
bronchoscopy	uses	flexible scope
flexible scope	enables	visualization
visualization	assists in	diagnosis
bronchoscopy	requires	sedation
sedation	reduces	patient discomfort
bronchoscopy	may cause	bleeding
bleeding	is a	complication
complication	increases	hospital stay
hospital stay	affects	recovery
bronchoscopy	performed by	pulmonologist
pulmonologist	specializes in	lung diseases
lung diseases	include	COPD
COPD	requires	management
management	involves	medications
medications	reduce	symptoms
symptoms	include	shortness of breath
shortness of breath	affects	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	surveys
surveys	assess	patient well-being
patient well-being	influences	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	improves	outcomes
outcomes	determine	prognosis
prognosis	guides	follow-up
follow-up	monitors	disease progression
disease progression	may require	adjusted therapy
adjusted therapy	prevents	exacerbations
exacerbations	lead to	hospitalizations
hospitalizations	increase	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	impact	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	affects	access to care
access to care	influences	early detection
early detection	improves	survival rates
survival rates	depend on	stage at diagnosis
stage at diagnosis	determines	treatment options
treatment options	include	surgery
surgery	removes	tumors
tumors	may be	malignant
malignant tumors	spread	metastases
metastases	complicate	treatment
treatment	involves	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	targets	cancer cells
cancer cells	mutate	resistance
resistance	reduces	drug efficacy
drug efficacy	measured by	response rates
response rates	guide	therapy adjustments
therapy adjustments	aim for	remission
remission	indicates	disease control
disease control	enhances	longevity
longevity	depends on	patient factors
patient factors	include	comorbidities
comorbidities	complicate	treatment plans
treatment plans	require	multidisciplinary teams
multidisciplinary teams	collaborate on	care strategies
care strategies	prioritize	patient needs
patient needs	vary by	demographics
demographics	influence	risk factors
risk factors	include	smoking
smoking	causes	lung damage
lung damage	leads to	fibrosis
fibrosis	reduces	lung function
lung function	tested by	spirometry
spirometry	measures	airflow
airflow	indicates	obstruction
obstruction	characterizes	asthma
asthma	treated with	inhalers
inhalers	deliver	bronchodilators
bronchodilators	relax	airways
airways	constrict during	attacks
attacks	triggered by	allergens
allergens	provoke	immune response
immune response	causes	inflammation
inflammation	treated with	steroids
steroids	suppress	immune activity
immune activity	protects against	infections
infections	prevented by	vaccines
vaccines	reduce	pneumonia risk
pneumonia	affects	alveoli
alveoli	exchange	gases
gases	include	oxygen
oxygen	essential for	cellular function
cellular function	impaired by	hypoxia
hypoxia	treated with	supplemental oxygen
supplemental oxygen	supports	vital organs
vital organs	include	brain
brain	controls	respiration
respiration	regulated by	brainstem
brainstem	damaged by	strokes
strokes	cause	neurological deficits
neurological deficits	assessed by	imaging
imaging	includes	CT scans
CT scans	visualize	lung structures
