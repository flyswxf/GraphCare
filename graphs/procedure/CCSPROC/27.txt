control of epistaxis	is a	medical procedure
control of epistaxis	treats	epistaxis
epistaxis	is a	bleeding disorder
epistaxis	occurs in	nasal cavity
nasal cavity	is part of	respiratory system
control of epistaxis	involves	nasal packing
nasal packing	uses	gauze
nasal packing	applies	pressure
control of epistaxis	may require	cauterization
cauterization	uses	silver nitrate
cauterization	stops	bleeding
control of epistaxis	may use	topical vasoconstrictors
topical vasoconstrictors	include	oxymetazoline
oxymetazoline	constricts	blood vessels
control of epistaxis	may require	endoscopic surgery
endoscopic surgery	identifies	bleeding source
epistaxis	caused by	trauma
epistaxis	caused by	hypertension
hypertension	increases	blood pressure
epistaxis	associated with	anticoagulant use
anticoagulant use	prolongs	clotting time
epistaxis	may lead to	anemia
anemia	reduces	hemoglobin levels
control of epistaxis	prevents	hypovolemia
hypovolemia	causes	shock
epistaxis	more common in	elderly
elderly	have	fragile blood vessels
epistaxis	occurs in	dry climates
dry climate	causes	nasal dryness
control of epistaxis	requires	patient education
patient education	includes	humidifier use
humidifier use	prevents	nasal dryness
epistaxis	classified as	anterior
epistaxis	classified as	posterior
posterior epistaxis	more severe than	anterior epistaxis
posterior epistaxis	requires	posterior packing
posterior packing	uses	balloon catheter
balloon catheter	exerts	pressure
control of epistaxis	may need	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	replaces	blood loss
epistaxis	associated with	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	causes	vascular malformations
control of epistaxis	may use	tranexamic acid
tranexamic acid	promotes	clot formation
epistaxis	diagnosed by	physical examination
physical examination	includes	nasal inspection
epistaxis	may require	imaging
imaging	includes	CT scan
CT scan	detects	vascular abnormalities
epistaxis	treated in	emergency department
emergency department	manages	acute bleeding
control of epistaxis	includes	vital signs monitoring
vital signs monitoring	assesses	hemodynamic stability
epistaxis	complications include	airway obstruction
airway obstruction	requires	emergency intervention
control of epistaxis	considers	anticoagulant reversal
anticoagulant reversal	uses	vitamin K
vitamin K	promotes	clotting factor synthesis
epistaxis	prevented by	nasal moisturizers
nasal moisturizers	contain	saline
saline	maintains	nasal moisture
epistaxis	related to	nasal cocaine use
nasal cocaine use	causes	vasoconstriction
control of epistaxis	may require	arterial ligation
arterial ligation	occludes	bleeding artery
epistaxis	associated with	liver disease
liver disease	impairs	clotting factor production
control of epistaxis	influenced by	coagulation status
coagulation status	assessed by	INR
INR	measures	anticoagulation effect
epistaxis	managed by	otolaryngologist
otolaryngologist	specializes in	ENT disorders
control of epistaxis	may use	fibrin glue
fibrin glue	forms	artificial clot
epistaxis	aggravated by	nose picking
nose picking	damages	nasal mucosa
control of epistaxis	includes	pain management
pain management	uses	analgesics
analgesics	relieve	discomfort
epistaxis	associated with	nasal tumors
nasal tumors	cause	abnormal bleeding
control of epistaxis	records	bleeding duration
bleeding duration	indicates	severity
epistaxis	affected by	seasonal variations
seasonal variations	influence	humidity levels
control of epistaxis	educates about	first aid
first aid	includes	pinching nostrils
pinching nostrils	applies	direct pressure
epistaxis	worsens with	aspirin use
aspirin use	inhibits	platelet function
control of epistaxis	monitors for	rebleeding
rebleeding	indicates	treatment failure
epistaxis	associated with	blood dyscrasias
blood dyscrasias	affect	blood components
control of epistaxis	considers	underlying cause
underlying cause	determines	treatment approach
epistaxis	documented in	medical records
medical records	track	treatment outcomes
control of epistaxis	improves with	timely intervention
timely intervention	prevents	complications
