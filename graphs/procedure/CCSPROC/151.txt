excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	treats	meniscal tear
excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	requires	anesthesia
excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	performed by	orthopedic surgeon
excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	has risk	infection
excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	has risk	bleeding
excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	followed by	physical therapy
excision of semilunar cartilage of knee	requires	postoperative care
meniscus	is part of	knee joint
meniscus	functions as	shock absorber
meniscus	can develop	degeneration
meniscus	can suffer	injury
meniscal tear	causes	knee pain
meniscal tear	results from	trauma
meniscal tear	leads to	knee locking
meniscal tear	causes	joint swelling
orthopedic surgeon	specializes in	musculoskeletal system
orthopedic surgeon	performs	arthroscopy
arthroscopy	is a	minimally invasive surgery
arthroscopy	used for	joint examination
arthroscopy	allows for	meniscectomy
meniscectomy	removes	damaged meniscus
meniscectomy	alternative to	meniscal repair
physical therapy	improves	joint mobility
physical therapy	reduces	recovery time
physical therapy	strengthens	thigh muscles
knee pain	treated with	analgesics
knee pain	managed with	ice therapy
analgesics	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	reduce	inflammation
NSAIDs	examples are	ibuprofen
postoperative care	involves	wound monitoring
postoperative care	includes	pain management
postoperative care	prevents	complications
knee joint	contains	synovial fluid
knee joint	supported by	ligaments
ligaments	provide	joint stability
ligaments	can suffer	sprains
trauma	results from	sports injury
trauma	caused by	fall
sports injury	common in	athletes
athletes	prone to	ACL tears
ACL tears	require	reconstruction
joint swelling	treated with	compression
joint swelling	relieved by	elevation
compression	uses	elastic bandage
elastic bandage	applies	pressure
knee locking	indicates	mechanical block
mechanical block	caused by	loose body
loose body	composed of	cartilage fragment
cartilage fragment	results from	degeneration
degeneration	associated with	osteoarthritis
osteoarthritis	causes	joint damage
osteoarthritis	leads to	disability
disability	requires	assistive devices
assistive devices	include	knee brace
knee brace	provides	support
knee brace	reduces	pain
anesthesia	types include	general anesthesia
anesthesia	types include	spinal anesthesia
general anesthesia	induces	unconsciousness
spinal anesthesia	blocks	nerve signals
nerve signals	transmit	pain sensations
pain sensations	processed by	brain
brain	controls	body movements
body movements	coordinated by	nervous system
nervous system	includes	peripheral nerves
peripheral nerves	can be	damaged
damaged nerves	cause	numbness
numbness	affects	sensation
sensation	important for	proprioception
proprioception	maintains	balance
balance	prevents	falls
falls	risk factor for	fractures
fractures	require	immobilization
immobilization	uses	cast
cast	protects	broken bone
broken bone	heals through	remodeling
remodeling	involves	osteoblasts
osteoblasts	produce	bone matrix
bone matrix	contains	collagen
collagen	provides	tensile strength
tensile strength	resists	mechanical stress
mechanical stress	affects	joint health
joint health	maintained by	exercise
exercise	improves	circulation
circulation	delivers	nutrients
nutrients	include	calcium
calcium	essential for	bone strength
bone strength	prevents	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	increases	fracture risk
fracture risk	reduced by	vitamin D
vitamin D	enhances	calcium absorption
calcium absorption	occurs in	intestines
intestines	part of	digestive system
digestive system	processes	food
food	provides	energy
energy	required for	healing
