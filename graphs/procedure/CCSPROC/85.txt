inguinal and femoral hernia repair	is a	surgical procedure
inguinal and femoral hernia repair	treats	hernia
inguinal hernia	is a type of	hernia
femoral hernia	is a type of	hernia
hernia	involves	abdominal wall
hernia repair	requires	anesthesia
general anesthesia	used in	hernia repair
local anesthesia	alternative for	hernia repair
hernia repair	has approach	open surgery
hernia repair	has approach	laparoscopic surgery
laparoscopic surgery	requires	smaller incisions
open surgery	requires	larger incision
mesh	used in	hernia repair
synthetic mesh	is a type of	mesh
biological mesh	is a type of	mesh
mesh	reduces	recurrence
hernia repair	has complication	infection
hernia repair	has complication	bleeding
hernia repair	has complication	chronic pain
chronic pain	affects	recovery
recovery	requires	postoperative care
postoperative care	includes	wound care
postoperative care	includes	pain management
pain management	involves	analgesics
opioids	are a type of	analgesics
NSAIDs	are a type of	analgesics
hernia repair	requires	preoperative evaluation
preoperative evaluation	includes	medical history
preoperative evaluation	includes	physical examination
physical examination	detects	hernia size
hernia size	affects	surgical approach
large hernia	may require	open repair
small hernia	may allow	laparoscopic repair
hernia repair	has risk factor	obesity
hernia repair	has risk factor	smoking
smoking	increases	surgical risks
obesity	increases	surgical risks
hernia repair	requires	hospital stay
hospital stay	depends on	procedure type
laparoscopic repair	allows	shorter stay
open repair	may require	longer stay
hernia repair	affects	physical activity
physical activity	restricted during	recovery
recovery period	varies by	procedure
recovery	monitored by	follow-up visits
follow-up visits	assess	wound healing
wound healing	affected by	patient health
diabetes	impacts	wound healing
elderly patients	have higher	complication rates
hernia repair	has alternative	watchful waiting
watchful waiting	monitors	hernia progression
hernia progression	may lead to	strangulation
strangulation	requires	emergency surgery
emergency surgery	has higher	mortality risk
elective surgery	has lower	complication rate
hernia repair	performed by	general surgeon
general surgeon	specializes in	abdominal surgery
surgical skill	affects	outcomes
surgical experience	reduces	complications
hernia repair	uses	sutures
non-absorbable sutures	provide	long-term support
absorbable sutures	used for	tissue approximation
tissue approximation	promotes	healing
hernia location	determines	repair technique
direct inguinal hernia	involves	Hesselbach's triangle
indirect inguinal hernia	involves	inguinal canal
femoral hernia	occurs in	femoral canal
femoral hernia	more common in	women
inguinal hernia	more common in	men
hernia prevalence	increases with	age
aging	weakens	abdominal muscles
abdominal muscles	prevent	hernia formation
heavy lifting	contributes to	hernia development
chronic cough	increases	intra-abdominal pressure
intra-abdominal pressure	causes	hernia
hernia repair	may require	bowel resection
bowel resection	needed for	strangulated hernia
bowel obstruction	complication of	hernia
bowel obstruction	requires	urgent treatment
hernia recurrence	affects	quality of life
quality of life	improves after	successful repair
patient satisfaction	measures	surgical success
surgical success	depends on	multiple factors
patient compliance	affects	recovery
rehabilitation	includes	gradual activity
physical therapy	aids	recovery
nutrition	supports	healing
protein intake	promotes	tissue repair
vitamin C	aids	collagen formation
collagen	strengthens	repair site
surgeon volume	correlates with	better outcomes
high-volume centers	have lower	complication rates
surgical training	improves	technique
simulation training	enhances	surgical skills
robotic surgery	alternative for	hernia repair
robotic surgery	offers	precision
precision	reduces	tissue trauma
tissue trauma	affects	recovery time
minimally invasive techniques	reduce	hospital costs
cost-effectiveness	considered in	procedure selection
