lung transplantation	is a type of	organ transplantation
pancreas transplantation	is a type of	organ transplantation
donor organ	obtained from	deceased donor
donor organ	obtained from	living donor
immunosuppressants	prevent	rejection
immunosuppressants	increase risk of	infection
tissue matching	involves	HLA testing
postoperative care	includes	infection monitoring
postoperative care	includes	organ function tests
organ failure	caused by	chronic disease
organ failure	caused by	acute injury
transplant surgeon	specializes in	transplantation
organ preservation	uses	cold storage
rejection	detected by	biopsy
rejection	classified as	acute
rejection	classified as	chronic
kidney transplantation	treats	end-stage renal disease
liver transplantation	treats	cirrhosis
heart transplantation	treats	heart failure
lung transplantation	treats	pulmonary fibrosis
pancreas transplantation	treats	type 1 diabetes
deceased donor	requires	brain death confirmation
living donor	undergoes	donor evaluation
HLA testing	assesses	tissue compatibility
chronic disease	includes	diabetes
chronic disease	includes	hypertension
acute injury	includes	trauma
cold storage	preserves	organ viability
biopsy	examines	tissue samples

cirrhosis	caused by	alcoholism
cirrhosis	caused by	hepatitis
heart failure	classified as	systolic
heart failure	classified as	diastolic
pulmonary fibrosis	characterized by	lung scarring
type 1 diabetes	results from	autoimmune destruction
brain death confirmation	requires	neurological tests
donor evaluation	assesses	medical suitability
dialysis	replaces	kidney function
alcoholism	leads to	liver damage
hepatitis	caused by	viral infection
autoimmune destruction	targets	beta cells
neurological tests	include	EEG
medical suitability	considers	donor health
viral infection	includes	hepatitis B

metabolism	occurs in	cells
cells	require	glucose
glucose	derived from	carbohydrates
carbohydrates	found in	food
transplant recipient	requires	lifelong monitoring
lifelong monitoring	includes	blood work
blood work	detects	complications
complications	include	infection
infection	treated with	antibiotics
