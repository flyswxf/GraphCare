tracheoscopy	indicates	stent placement need
laryngoscopy	determines	surgical approach
biopsy	influences	chemotherapy decision
chemotherapy	treats	confirmed malignancy
procedure	requires	informed consent
informed consent	explains	procedure risks
tracheoscopy	monitors	treatment response
laryngoscopy	follows up	radiation therapy
radiation therapy	affects	laryngeal tissue
biopsy	repeated for	treatment monitoring
procedure	timed with	disease progression
disease progression	necessitates	treatment adjustment
