diagnostic amniocentesis	is a	prenatal test
diagnostic amniocentesis	detects	chromosomal abnormalities
diagnostic amniocentesis	performed during	second trimester
diagnostic amniocentesis	involves	amniotic fluid extraction
amniotic fluid	contains	fetal cells
fetal cells	used for	genetic analysis
genetic analysis	identifies	Down syndrome
Down syndrome	caused by	trisomy 21
trisomy 21	detected by	karyotyping
karyotyping	performed in	cytogenetics lab
diagnostic amniocentesis	requires	ultrasound guidance
ultrasound guidance	ensures	needle placement
needle placement	avoids	placental injury
placental injury	may cause	bleeding
bleeding	increases risk of	miscarriage
miscarriage	potential complication of	amniocentesis
amniocentesis	contraindicated in	active infections
active infections	include	hepatitis B
hepatitis B	screened before	amniocentesis
screening tests	include	maternal blood work
diagnostic amniocentesis	alternative to	chorionic villus sampling
chorionic villus sampling	performed earlier than	amniocentesis
chorionic villus sampling	higher risk than	amniocentesis
risk assessment	done by	genetic counselor
genetic counselor	provides	pre-test counseling
pre-test counseling	discusses	procedure risks
procedure risks	include	infection
infection	prevented by	sterile technique
sterile technique	requires	skin preparation
skin preparation	uses	antiseptic solution
diagnostic amniocentesis	results in	laboratory report
laboratory report	contains	genetic findings
genetic findings	reveal	sex chromosomes
sex chromosomes	determine	fetal sex
fetal sex	identifiable by	PCR
PCR	amplifies	DNA sequences
DNA sequences	analyzed for	mutations
mutations	associated with	cystic fibrosis
cystic fibrosis	screened in	carrier testing
carrier testing	recommended for	high-risk couples
diagnostic amniocentesis	timing at	15-20 weeks
15-20 weeks gestation	optimal for	cell culture
cell culture	grows	amniocytes
amniocytes	examined for	chromosomal defects
chromosomal defects	include	Turner syndrome
Turner syndrome	characterized by	XO karyotype
XO karyotype	results in	short stature
short stature	managed with	growth hormone
growth hormone	prescribed by	endocrinologist
endocrinologist	specializes in	hormonal disorders
diagnostic amniocentesis	followed by	post-procedure monitoring
post-procedure monitoring	checks for	contractions
contractions	may indicate	preterm labor
preterm labor	prevented by	bed rest
bed rest	reduces	uterine activity
uterine activity	monitored by	tocodynamometer
tocodynamometer	measures	contraction frequency
contraction frequency	recorded in	medical chart
medical chart	reviewed by	obstetrician
obstetrician	manages	pregnancy care
diagnostic amniocentesis	indications include	advanced maternal age
advanced maternal age	defined as	>35 years
>35 years	increases risk of	aneuploidy
aneuploidy	screened by	NIPT
NIPT	less invasive than	amniocentesis
NIPT	analyzes	cell-free DNA
cell-free DNA	originates from	placenta
placenta	produces	pregnancy hormones
pregnancy hormones	include	hCG
hCG	detected in	urine tests
diagnostic amniocentesis	contraindications include	placenta previa
placenta previa	causes	bleeding in pregnancy
bleeding in pregnancy	evaluated by	ultrasound
ultrasound	determines	placental location
placental location	affects	delivery method
delivery method	may require	cesarean section
cesarean section	performed by	surgeon
surgeon	assisted by	surgical team
surgical team	includes	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	administers	spinal anesthesia
diagnostic amniocentesis	complications include	amniotic fluid leakage
amniotic fluid leakage	leads to	oligohydramnios
oligohydramnios	affects	lung development
lung development	assessed by	fetal ultrasound
fetal ultrasound	measures	amniotic fluid index
amniotic fluid index	normal range	5-25cm
5-25cm	maintained by	fluid homeostasis
fluid homeostasis	regulated by	fetal kidneys
fetal kidneys	produce	urine
urine	contributes to	amniotic fluid
diagnostic amniocentesis	alternatives include	cell-free DNA testing
cell-free DNA testing	screens for	trisomies
trisomies	include	Edwards syndrome
Edwards syndrome	involves	trisomy 18
trisomy 18	associated with	congenital heart defects
congenital heart defects	diagnosed by	fetal echocardiogram
fetal echocardiogram	performed by	perinatologist
perinatologist	specializes in	high-risk pregnancies
high-risk pregnancies	require	specialized care
specialized care	provided at	tertiary hospital
