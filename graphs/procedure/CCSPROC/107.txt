extracorporeal lithotripsy	is a	medical procedure
extracorporeal lithotripsy	treats	kidney stones
extracorporeal lithotripsy	uses	shock waves
extracorporeal lithotripsy	non-invasive	treatment
extracorporeal lithotripsy	alternative to	surgery
kidney stones	located in	urinary tract
kidney stones	cause	pain
kidney stones	composed of	minerals
shock waves	break down	stones
shock waves	generated by	lithotripter
lithotripter	requires	imaging guidance
imaging guidance	uses	ultrasound
imaging guidance	uses	x-ray
urinary tract	includes	kidneys
urinary tract	includes	ureters
urinary tract	includes	bladder
urinary tract	includes	urethra
pain	managed by	analgesics
analgesics	include	NSAIDs
analgesics	include	opioids
NSAIDs	reduce	inflammation
opioids	relieve	severe pain
ureters	transport	urine
bladder	stores	urine
urethra	excretes	urine
extracorporeal lithotripsy	requires	pre-procedure evaluation
pre-procedure evaluation	includes	blood tests
pre-procedure evaluation	includes	urine tests
blood tests	assess	kidney function
urine tests	detect	infections
infections	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	bacteria
bacteria	cause	UTIs
UTIs	contraindication for	lithotripsy
extracorporeal lithotripsy	has	success rate
success rate	depends on	stone size
stone size	measured in	millimeters
small stones	more responsive to	lithotripsy
large stones	require	multiple sessions
multiple sessions	increase	recovery time
recovery time	affected by	complications
complications	include	bleeding
complications	include	infection
bleeding	managed by	observation
infection	prevented by	antibiotics
extracorporeal lithotripsy	followed by	hydration
hydration	facilitates	stone passage
stone passage	monitored by	imaging
imaging	confirms	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	recurrence risk
recurrence risk	lowered by	dietary changes
dietary changes	include	fluid intake
dietary changes	include	sodium restriction
sodium restriction	prevents	stone formation
stone formation	influenced by	diet
diet	affects	urine composition
urine composition	analyzed by	24-hour test
24-hour test	measures	mineral levels
mineral levels	indicate	risk factors
risk factors	include	hypercalciuria
hypercalciuria	treated with	thiazides
thiazides	reduce	calcium excretion
calcium excretion	contributes to	stones
extracorporeal lithotripsy	alternative to	ureteroscopy
ureteroscopy	uses	laser
laser	fragments	stones
fragmented stones	removed by	basket
basket	inserted through	ureteroscope
ureteroscope	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	types include	general
anesthesia	types include	spinal
general anesthesia	induces	unconsciousness
spinal anesthesia	blocks	sensation
extracorporeal lithotripsy	preferred for	renal stones
renal stones	located in	kidney
kidney	filters	blood
blood	contains	waste products
waste products	form	crystals
crystals	aggregate into	stones
extracorporeal lithotripsy	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	alters	anatomy
anatomy changes	affect	stone location
stone location	determines	treatment approach
treatment approach	considers	patient history
patient history	includes	comorbidities
comorbidities	such as	diabetes
diabetes	increases	infection risk
infection risk	requires	prophylaxis
prophylaxis	involves	antibiotics
extracorporeal lithotripsy	performed by	urologist
urologist	specializes in	urinary system
urinary system	disorders include	nephrolithiasis
nephrolithiasis	medical term for	kidney stones
extracorporeal lithotripsy	developed in	1980s
1980s	marked	medical advancement
medical advancement	improves	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	measured by	quality metrics
quality metrics	include	pain scores
pain scores	assess	treatment efficacy
treatment efficacy	determines	follow-up care
