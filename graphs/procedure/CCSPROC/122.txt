removal of ectopic pregnancy	is a	surgical procedure
removal of ectopic pregnancy	treats	ectopic pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	is a	pregnancy complication
ectopic pregnancy	occurs in	fallopian tube
fallopian tube	is part of	female reproductive system
female reproductive system	includes	uterus
uterus	is site of	normal pregnancy
normal pregnancy	differs from	ectopic pregnancy
removal of ectopic pregnancy	prevents	rupture
rupture	causes	internal bleeding
internal bleeding	requires	emergency treatment
emergency treatment	may include	blood transfusion
blood transfusion	replaces	lost blood
lost blood	results from	hemorrhage
hemorrhage	is complication of	ectopic pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	diagnosed by	ultrasound
ultrasound	uses	sound waves
sound waves	create	images
images	show	pregnancy location
pregnancy location	determines	treatment
treatment	may be	medical
medical treatment	uses	methotrexate
methotrexate	stops	cell growth
cell growth	necessary for	pregnancy
pregnancy	requires	implantation
implantation	normally occurs in	uterus
uterus	prepares for	implantation
implantation	begins	pregnancy
pregnancy	confirmed by	hCG test
hCG test	measures	hormone levels
hormone levels	indicate	pregnancy viability
pregnancy viability	assessed by	doctor
doctor	performs	removal of ectopic pregnancy
removal of ectopic pregnancy	may involve	laparoscopy
laparoscopy	is a	minimally invasive surgery
minimally invasive surgery	uses	small incisions
small incisions	reduce	recovery time
recovery time	depends on	procedure type
procedure type	chosen based on	patient condition
patient condition	evaluated by	medical history
medical history	includes	previous pregnancies
previous pregnancies	may increase	risk
risk	factors include	pelvic inflammatory disease
pelvic inflammatory disease	caused by	infection
infection	may result from	STIs
STIs	include	chlamydia
chlamydia	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	prevent	complications
complications	include	infertility
infertility	may follow	ectopic pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	affects	future fertility
future fertility	depends on	tube condition
tube condition	assessed after	surgery
surgery	may damage	fallopian tube
fallopian tube	transports	egg
egg	fertilized by	sperm
sperm	meets egg in	fallopian tube
fertilized egg	becomes	embryo
embryo	implants in	uterus
implantation failure	leads to	ectopic pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	detected by	symptoms
symptoms	include	abdominal pain
abdominal pain	may indicate	various conditions
various conditions	require	differential diagnosis
differential diagnosis	excludes	other causes
other causes	include	appendicitis
appendicitis	treated with	appendectomy
appendectomy	differs from	removal of ectopic pregnancy
removal of ectopic pregnancy	performed by	gynecologist
gynecologist	specializes in	women's health
women's health	covers	reproductive issues
reproductive issues	include	infertility
infertility	treated by	fertility specialist
fertility specialist	may recommend	IVF
IVF	bypasses	fallopian tubes
fallopian tubes	not needed for	IVF
IVF	involves	embryo transfer
embryo transfer	places embryo in	uterus
uterus	nurtures	developing fetus
developing fetus	grows into	baby
baby	delivered via	childbirth
childbirth	may be	vaginal
vaginal delivery	preferred over	C-section
C-section	is a	surgical delivery
surgical delivery	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	administered by	anesthesiologist
anesthesiologist	monitors	patient vitals
patient vitals	include	blood pressure
blood pressure	indicates	cardiovascular health
cardiovascular health	affects	surgery outcome
surgery outcome	depends on	patient health
patient health	improved by	postoperative care
postoperative care	includes	pain management
pain management	uses	analgesics
analgesics	relieve	discomfort
discomfort	common after	surgery
surgery	may cause	scarring
scarring	minimized by	proper technique
proper technique	employed by	skilled surgeon
skilled surgeon	performs	removal of ectopic pregnancy
