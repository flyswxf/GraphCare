nervous system procedure	is a	medical procedure
therapeutic nervous system procedure	is a type of	nervous system procedure
nervous system procedure	treats	neurological disorder
deep brain stimulation	is a type of	therapeutic nervous system procedure
deep brain stimulation	treats	Parkinson's disease
deep brain stimulation	involves	electrode implantation
electrode implantation	requires	neurosurgery
neurosurgery	performed by	neurosurgeon
neurosurgeon	specializes in	nervous system
nervous system	consists of	brain
nervous system	consists of	spinal cord
spinal cord stimulation	is a type of	therapeutic nervous system procedure
spinal cord stimulation	treats	chronic pain
chronic pain	can be caused by	nerve damage
nerve damage	may require	nerve repair
nerve repair	is a type of	therapeutic nervous system procedure
nerve repair	involves	nerve grafting
nerve grafting	uses	autograft
autograft	comes from	patient's own tissue
nerve decompression	is a type of	therapeutic nervous system procedure
nerve decompression	treats	carpal tunnel syndrome
carpal tunnel syndrome	involves	median nerve
median nerve	is part of	peripheral nervous system
peripheral nervous system	connects to	central nervous system
central nervous system	includes	brain
brain surgery	is a type of	nervous system procedure
brain surgery	may involve	tumor removal
tumor removal	requires	imaging guidance
imaging guidance	uses	MRI
MRI	provides	brain images
brain images	help diagnose	neurological conditions
neurological conditions	may require	medication
medication	can be	anticonvulsants
anticonvulsants	treat	epilepsy
epilepsy	may require	vagus nerve stimulation
vagus nerve stimulation	is a type of	therapeutic nervous system procedure
vagus nerve stimulation	involves	device implantation
device implantation	requires	surgical procedure
surgical procedure	has risk of	infection
infection	may require	antibiotics
antibiotics	prescribed by	physician
physician	may refer to	neurologist
neurologist	specializes in	nervous system disorders
nervous system disorders	include	multiple sclerosis
multiple sclerosis	may require	plasma exchange
plasma exchange	is a type of	therapeutic procedure
plasma exchange	filters	blood
blood	contains	antibodies
antibodies	may attack	myelin sheath
myelin sheath	protects	nerve fibers
nerve fibers	transmit	nerve impulses
nerve impulses	disrupted in	neuropathy
neuropathy	treated with	physical therapy
physical therapy	improves	nerve function
nerve function	measured by	nerve conduction study
nerve conduction study	is a type of	diagnostic procedure
diagnostic procedure	precedes	treatment planning
treatment planning	involves	multidisciplinary team
multidisciplinary team	includes	neurosurgeon
neurosurgeon	performs	stereotactic surgery
stereotactic surgery	is a type of	nervous system procedure
stereotactic surgery	uses	3D imaging
3D imaging	allows for	precise targeting
precise targeting	reduces	surgical complications
surgical complications	may include	bleeding
bleeding	controlled with	hemostasis
hemostasis	achieved through	cauterization
cauterization	uses	electrical current
electrical current	affects	nerve tissue
nerve tissue	can regenerate	slowly
nerve regeneration	enhanced by	growth factors
growth factors	administered via	injection
injection	is a type of	medical procedure
medical procedure	requires	informed consent
informed consent	explains	procedure risks
procedure risks	may include	nerve damage
nerve damage	causes	paresthesia
paresthesia	characterized by	tingling sensation
tingling sensation	may indicate	nerve irritation
nerve irritation	treated with	anti-inflammatory drugs
anti-inflammatory drugs	reduce	swelling
swelling	compresses	nerves
nerve compression	treated with	decompression surgery
decompression surgery	relieves	pressure
pressure	causes	pain
pain	managed with	pain medication
pain medication	may be	opioids
opioids	have risk of	addiction
addiction	treated with	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	includes	counseling
counseling	helps with	mental health
mental health	affected by	chronic pain
chronic pain	treated with	neuromodulation
neuromodulation	is a type of	therapeutic nervous system procedure
neuromodulation	alters	nerve activity
nerve activity	measured by	EEG
EEG	detects	brain waves
brain waves	indicate	neurological function
neurological function	impaired in	stroke
stroke	treated with	emergency intervention
