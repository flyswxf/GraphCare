coronary thrombolysis	is a	medical procedure
coronary thrombolysis	treats	myocardial infarction
coronary thrombolysis	dissolves	blood clots
coronary thrombolysis	uses	thrombolytic drugs
coronary thrombolysis	requires	rapid administration
coronary thrombolysis	contraindicated in	hemorrhagic stroke
coronary thrombolysis	reduces	mortality
coronary thrombolysis	improves	cardiac output
coronary thrombolysis	prevents	heart failure
coronary thrombolysis	limited by	time window
coronary thrombolysis	alternative to	PCI
coronary thrombolysis	causes	reperfusion injury
coronary thrombolysis	risks	bleeding
coronary thrombolysis	monitored with	ECG
coronary thrombolysis	followed by	anticoagulation
myocardial infarction	caused by	coronary occlusion
myocardial infarction	leads to	ischemia
myocardial infarction	diagnosed with	troponin
thrombolytic drugs	include	alteplase
thrombolytic drugs	include	streptokinase
thrombolytic drugs	activate	plasminogen
plasminogen	converts to	plasmin
plasmin	degrades	fibrin
fibrin	forms	blood clots
blood clots	obstruct	coronary arteries
PCI	stands for	percutaneous coronary intervention
PCI	involves	stent placement
stent placement	maintains	vessel patency
reperfusion injury	causes	oxidative stress
bleeding	monitored with	hemoglobin
anticoagulation	prevents	reocclusion
anticoagulation	uses	heparin
heparin	inhibits	thrombin
ECG	shows	ST elevation
ST elevation	indicates	STEMI
STEMI	requires	emergency treatment
time window	typically within	12 hours
rapid administration	improves	outcomes
cardiac output	measured by	echocardiography
heart failure	treated with	diuretics
diuretics	reduce	fluid overload
hemorrhagic stroke	contraindicates	thrombolysis
coronary arteries	supply	myocardium
myocardium	requires	oxygen
ischemia	causes	angina
troponin	released from	cardiomyocytes
cardiomyocytes	damaged by	infarction
alteplase	is a	recombinant tPA
streptokinase	derived from	bacteria
plasminogen	produced in	liver
fibrin	formed from	fibrinogen
coronary arteries	affected by	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	involves	plaque buildup
plaque buildup	narrows	arteries
stents	coated with	drugs
drug-eluting stents	prevent	restenosis
oxidative stress	damages	cell membranes
hemoglobin	carries	oxygen
thrombin	converts	fibrinogen
ST elevation	localized in	affected area
emergency treatment	includes	oxygen
12 hours	based on	tissue viability
outcomes	measured by	ejection fraction
echocardiography	assesses	wall motion
fluid overload	causes	pulmonary edema
pulmonary edema	impairs	gas exchange
thrombolysis	avoided in	recent surgery
myocardium	composed of	muscle tissue
oxygen	delivered via	circulation
angina	manifests as	chest pain
infarction	leads to	necrosis
recombinant tPA	genetically engineered
bacteria	produce	streptokinase
liver	synthesizes	clotting factors
fibrinogen	cleaved by	thrombin
atherosclerosis	risk factor	smoking
plaque	contains	cholesterol
narrowed arteries	reduce	blood flow
drug coating	prevents	smooth muscle proliferation
restenosis	is	re-narrowing
cell membranes	damaged by	free radicals
oxygen	bound to	hemoglobin
fibrinogen	precursor of	clot
affected area	corresponds to	artery
oxygen therapy	increases	saturation
tissue viability	assessed by	imaging
ejection fraction	indicates	systolic function
wall motion	abnormal in	ischemia
gas exchange	occurs in	alveoli
recent surgery	increases	bleeding risk
muscle tissue	requires	ATP
circulation	maintained by	heart
chest pain	relieved by	nitroglycerin
necrosis	releases	enzymes
genetic engineering	produces	tPA
clotting factors	include	prothrombin
smoking	damages	endothelium
cholesterol	accumulates in	plaques
blood flow	measured by	angiography
smooth muscle proliferation	causes	restenosis
