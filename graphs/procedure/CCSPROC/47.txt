diagnostic cardiac catheterization	is a	medical procedure
coronary arteriography	is a type of	diagnostic cardiac catheterization
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	evaluates	coronary arteries
coronary arteriography	visualizes	coronary artery blockages
coronary arteriography	requires	contrast dye
contrast dye	may cause	allergic reaction
allergic reaction	treated with	antihistamines
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	measures	blood pressure in heart chambers
blood pressure measurement	indicates	heart function
coronary arteriography	detects	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	leads to	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	treated with	statins
statins	lower	LDL cholesterol
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	assesses	heart valve function
heart valve dysfunction	may require	valve replacement
valve replacement	involves	prosthetic valve
prosthetic valve	requires	anticoagulants
coronary arteriography	guides	angioplasty
angioplasty	uses	stent
stent	prevents	artery re-narrowing
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	performed by	cardiologist
cardiologist	specializes in	cardiovascular diseases
cardiovascular diseases	include	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	diagnosed with	troponin test
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	requires	femoral artery access
femoral artery access	risks	hematoma
hematoma	managed with	compression
coronary arteriography	contraindicated in	severe kidney disease
severe kidney disease	increases	contrast nephropathy risk
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	preceded by	pre-procedure blood tests
pre-procedure blood tests	check	coagulation status
abnormal coagulation	requires	transfusion
coronary arteriography	identifies	coronary anomalies
coronary anomalies	associated with	sudden cardiac death
sudden cardiac death	prevented by	ICD
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	evaluates	ventricular function
ventricular dysfunction	treated with	beta-blockers
beta-blockers	reduce	heart rate
coronary arteriography	differentiates	stable vs unstable angina
unstable angina	requires	emergency intervention
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	utilizes	fluoroscopy
fluoroscopy	emits	X-rays
X-ray exposure	minimized with	lead shielding
coronary arteriography	quantifies	stenosis severity
severe stenosis	indicates	CABG
CABG	uses	saphenous vein graft
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	monitors	oxygen saturation
low oxygen saturation	suggests	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	diagnosed with	CT pulmonary angiography
coronary arteriography	contraindicated in	active bleeding
active bleeding	managed with	tranexamic acid
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	assesses	pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary hypertension	treated with	vasodilators
vasodilators	include	sildenafil
coronary arteriography	reveals	collateral circulation
collateral circulation	protects against	ischemia
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	requires	local anesthesia
local anesthesia	achieved with	lidocaine
lidocaine toxicity	causes	seizures
coronary arteriography	evaluates	stent patency
stent thrombosis	treated with	dual antiplatelet therapy
dual antiplatelet therapy	combines	aspirin and clopidogrel
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	checks	cardiac output
low cardiac output	indicates	cardiogenic shock
cardiogenic shock	managed with	inotropes
coronary arteriography	detects	spontaneous coronary dissection
spontaneous coronary dissection	more common in	postpartum women
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	rules out	vasospastic angina
vasospastic angina	treated with	calcium channel blockers
calcium channel blockers	relax	vascular smooth muscle
coronary arteriography	measures	fractional flow reserve
fractional flow reserve	determines	revascularization need
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	examines	left main disease
left main disease	requires	urgent surgery
coronary arteriography	identifies	thrombus
thrombus	dissolved with	thrombolytics
thrombolytics	include	alteplase
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	contraindicated in	aortic dissection
aortic dissection	diagnosed with	CT aortography
coronary arteriography	evaluates	bypass graft patency
graft occlusion	leads to	recurrent ischemia
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	assesses	intracardiac shunts
intracardiac shunts	quantified by	oximetry
coronary arteriography	detects	myocardial bridging
myocardial bridging	causes	systolic compression
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	requires	heparinization
heparin	reversed with	protamine
coronary arteriography	visualizes	calcifications
coronary calcifications	predict	plaque burden
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	checks	right heart pressures
elevated right heart pressures	suggest	pulmonary disease
coronary arteriography	differentiates	Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy	mimics	myocardial infarction
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	evaluates	prosthetic valve function
prosthetic valve dysfunction	causes	paravalvular leak
coronary arteriography	identifies	coronary fistulas
coronary fistulas	may require	embolization
diagnostic cardiac catheterization	measures	LVEDP
elevated LVEDP	indicates	heart failure
heart failure	managed with	diuretics
