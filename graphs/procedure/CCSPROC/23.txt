otitis media	leads to	fever
otitis media	diagnosed by	otoscopy
otoscopy	examines	eardrum
eardrum	separates	outer ear
eardrum	transmits	sound
anesthesia	ensures	pain relief
anesthesia	requires	monitoring
hearing loss	impacts	communication
hearing loss	assessed by	audiometry
audiometry	measures	hearing ability
fluid	contains	bacteria
bacteria	causes	infection
infection	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	bacteria
antibiotics	prescribed by	physician
physician	recommends	myringotomy
surgical procedure	performed in	operating room
operating room	equipped with	surgical tools

surgery	requires	recovery time
recovery time	involves	follow-up
follow-up	checks	healing
healing	restores	function
function	improves	hearing
hearing	depends on	eardrum integrity
eardrum integrity	affected by	perforation
perforation	repaired by	tympanoplasty
tympanoplasty	reconstructs	eardrum
reconstructs	uses	graft
graft	taken from	tissue
tissue	heals	wound
wound	requires	care
care	prevents	complications
complications	include	infection
