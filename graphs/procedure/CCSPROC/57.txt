stenosis	treated by	angioplasty
infection	treated by	antibiotics
thrombosis	treated by	thrombolysis
arteriovenous fistula	associated with	chronic kidney disease
vessel-to-vessel cannula	associated with	acute kidney injury
chronic kidney disease	leads to	hemodialysis
acute kidney injury	may require	temporary dialysis
creation of arteriovenous fistula	has complication	bleeding
revision of arteriovenous fistula	has complication	hematoma
removal of arteriovenous fistula	has complication	nerve injury
creation of vessel-to-vessel cannula	has complication	vessel perforation
revision of vessel-to-vessel cannula	has complication	dislodgement
removal of vessel-to-vessel cannula	has complication	bleeding
arteriovenous fistula	has better	patency rate
vessel-to-vessel cannula	has shorter	lifespan
patency rate	influenced by	patient factors
patient factors	include	diabetes
diabetes	increases risk	vascular complications
hypertension	increases risk	stenosis
smoking	decreases	fistula survival

hemodialysis	depends on	access functionality
access functionality	measured by	flow rate
low flow rate	indicates	stenosis
high flow rate	indicates	steal syndrome
steal syndrome	causes	ischemia
ischemia	treated by	access ligation
access ligation	leads to	new access creation
new access creation	may involve	alternative site
alternative site	includes	upper arm
upper arm fistula	has higher	success rate
forearm fistula	has lower	success rate
success rate	affected by	vein quality
vein quality	assessed by	preoperative mapping
preoperative mapping	uses	Doppler ultrasound
Doppler ultrasound	detects	vein diameter
vein diameter	determines	suitability
unsuitable vein	requires	graft placement
graft placement	uses	synthetic material
synthetic graft	has higher	infection risk
infection risk	reduced by	sterile technique
sterile technique	includes	skin preparation
skin preparation	involves	antiseptic solution
antiseptic solution	examples	chlorhexidine
chlorhexidine	prevents	bacterial colonization
bacterial colonization	leads to	biofilm formation
biofilm formation	causes	recurrent infection
recurrent infection	requires	graft removal
graft removal	followed by	antibiotic therapy
antibiotic therapy	duration	4-6 weeks
4-6 weeks	allows	tissue healing
tissue healing	monitored by	wound care
wound care	includes	dressing changes
dressing changes	prevent	contamination
contamination	leads to	delayed healing
delayed healing	prolongs	recovery time
