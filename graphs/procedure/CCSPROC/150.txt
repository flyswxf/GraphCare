division of joint capsule	is a	surgical procedure
ligament	is a	connective tissue
cartilage	is a	connective tissue
division of joint capsule	involves	ligament
division of joint capsule	involves	cartilage
ligament	connects	bones
cartilage	cushions	joints
ligament tear	requires	surgical repair
cartilage damage	requires	surgical repair
division of joint capsule	treats	joint instability
joint instability	caused by	ligament injury
joint instability	caused by	cartilage damage
division of joint capsule	performed using	arthroscopy
arthroscopy	is a	minimally invasive surgery
division of joint capsule	followed by	physical therapy
physical therapy	improves	joint mobility
physical therapy	reduces	post-surgical stiffness
ligament	prevents	excessive joint movement
cartilage	absorbs	shock
division of joint capsule	may lead	joint swelling
joint swelling	managed with	anti-inflammatory drugs
anti-inflammatory drugs	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	reduce	pain
NSAIDs	reduce	inflammation
cartilage damage	leads to	osteoarthritis
osteoarthritis	causes	chronic pain
chronic pain	treated with	analgesics
ligament injury	common in	athletes
athletes	prone to	joint injuries
division of joint capsule	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	includes	local anesthesia
anesthesia	includes	general anesthesia
general anesthesia	induces	unconsciousness
local anesthesia	numbs	surgical area
division of joint capsule	risks	infection
infection	prevented with	antibiotics
antibiotics	kill	bacteria
division of joint capsule	may require	post-op immobilization
post-op immobilization	uses	brace
brace	supports	joint
ligament	composed of	collagen fibers
cartilage	lacks	blood vessels
cartilage	heals	slowly
slow healing	prolongs	recovery time
recovery time	depends on	patient age
patient age	affects	tissue regeneration
division of joint capsule	alternative to	joint replacement
joint replacement	involves	prosthetic implant
prosthetic implant	mimics	natural joint
division of joint capsule	cheaper than	joint replacement
ligament injury	diagnosed with	MRI
MRI	provides	detailed images
cartilage damage	diagnosed with	X-ray
X-ray	detects	bone abnormalities
division of joint capsule	contraindicated in	severe arthritis
severe arthritis	treated with	joint fusion
joint fusion	limits	joint movement
division of joint capsule	preserves	joint function
joint function	measured by	range of motion
range of motion	improved by	stretching
stretching	prevents	muscle atrophy
muscle atrophy	weakens	joint support
ligament injury	classified as	sprain
sprain	graded by	severity
cartilage damage	graded by	Outerbridge scale
Outerbridge scale	assesses	cartilage lesions
division of joint capsule	performed by	orthopedic surgeon
orthopedic surgeon	specializes	musculoskeletal system
musculoskeletal system	includes	joints
joints	enable	movement
movement	controlled by	muscles
muscles	attached to	bones
bones	connected by	ligaments
ligaments	stabilize	joints
cartilage	found in	synovial joints
synovial joints	contain	synovial fluid
synovial fluid	lubricates	joints
division of joint capsule	affects	synovial membrane
synovial membrane	produces	synovial fluid
division of joint capsule	alters	joint biomechanics
joint biomechanics	studied in	kinesiology
kinesiology	examines	body movement
body movement	essential for	daily activities
daily activities	impacted by	joint pain
joint pain	alleviated by	rest
rest	promotes	tissue healing
tissue healing	involves	inflammation phase
inflammation phase	initiates	repair process
repair process	requires	collagen synthesis
collagen synthesis	depends on	vitamin C
vitamin C	found in	citrus fruits
citrus fruits	boost	immune system
immune system	fights	infections
division of joint capsule	monitored with	follow-up visits
follow-up visits	assess	recovery progress
recovery progress	evaluated by	physiotherapist
physiotherapist	designs	rehabilitation plan
rehabilitation plan	includes	strengthening exercises
strengthening exercises	build	muscle support
muscle support	protects	joints
