myocardial infarction	causes	heart damage
ace inhibitors	compete with	ARBs
ARBs	alternative to	ace inhibitors
ARBs	avoid	cough side effect
cough side effect	mediated by	bradykinin
bradykinin	broken down by	ACE
ACE	stands for	angiotensin-converting enzyme
angiotensin-converting enzyme	converts	angiotensin I
angiotensin I	converts to	angiotensin II
angiotensin II	causes	vasoconstriction
vasoconstriction	increases	blood pressure
ace inhibitors	block	angiotensin II formation
angiotensin II	stimulates	aldosterone release
aldosterone	promotes	sodium retention
sodium retention	increases	fluid volume
fluid volume	affects	blood pressure
ace inhibitors	decrease	aldosterone levels
aldosterone levels	influence	potassium excretion
potassium excretion	affects	serum potassium
serum potassium	monitored during	ACE inhibitor therapy
ACE inhibitor therapy	requires	renal function tests
renal function tests	measure	creatinine levels
creatinine levels	indicate	kidney function
kidney function	affects	drug clearance
drug clearance	determines	dosage
dosage	adjusted for	elderly patients
elderly patients	have	increased sensitivity
increased sensitivity	requires	lower doses
lower doses	reduce	adverse effects
adverse effects	include	hypotension
hypotension	causes	dizziness
dizziness	increases	fall risk
fall risk	concerns	geriatric patients
geriatric patients	need	careful monitoring
careful monitoring	includes	blood tests
blood tests	check for	electrolyte imbalances
electrolyte imbalances	involve	sodium
electrolyte imbalances	involve	potassium
potassium imbalances	cause	arrhythmias
arrhythmias	require	ECG monitoring
ECG monitoring	detects	QT prolongation
QT prolongation	risks	torsades de pointes
torsades de pointes	is	life-threatening
life-threatening arrhythmias	need	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	affected by	medication adherence
medication adherence	improves	outcomes
outcomes	measured by	mortality rates
mortality rates	higher in	non-adherent patients
non-adherent patients	have	more complications
complications	include	stroke
complications	include	heart attack
heart attack	treated with	emergency care
emergency care	involves	revascularization
revascularization	includes	stenting
stenting	requires	antiplatelet therapy
antiplatelet therapy	combines with	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	improve	post-MI survival
post-MI survival	depends on	ejection fraction
ejection fraction	measured by	echocardiogram
echocardiogram	assesses	cardiac function
cardiac function	predicts	readmission risk
readmission risk	reduced by	guideline therapy
guideline therapy	includes	beta blockers
beta blockers	complement	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	part of	standard regimen
standard regimen	follows	clinical guidelines
clinical guidelines	based on	randomized trials
randomized trials	establish	efficacy
efficacy	compared to	placebo
placebo	controls for	bias
bias	affects	study validity
