anti-dementia drugs	treat	dementia
dementia	has type	Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease	characterized by	amyloid plaques
amyloid plaques	contain	beta-amyloid
beta-amyloid	derived from	APP
APP	encoded by	APP gene
anti-dementia drugs	include	cholinesterase inhibitors
cholinesterase inhibitors	example	donepezil
donepezil	increases	acetylcholine
acetylcholine	is	neurotransmitter
neurotransmitter	involved in	memory
memory	impaired in	dementia
anti-dementia drugs	include	memantine
memantine	acts on	NMDA receptors
NMDA receptors	regulate	calcium influx
calcium influx	affects	neuronal excitability
neuronal excitability	altered in	dementia
anti-dementia drugs	may cause	side effects
side effects	include	nausea
nausea	can be treated with	antiemetics
dementia	associated with	aging
aging	risk factor for	dementia
anti-dementia drugs	prescribed by	neurologists
neurologists	specialize in	nervous system
nervous system	includes	brain
brain	affected by	dementia
dementia	may lead to	disability
disability	measured by	ADL scale
ADL scale	assesses	daily functioning
daily functioning	impaired in	dementia
anti-dementia drugs	can improve	cognition
cognition	includes	executive function
executive function	controlled by	prefrontal cortex
prefrontal cortex	degenerates in	dementia
anti-dementia drugs	metabolized by	liver
liver	contains	cytochrome P450
cytochrome P450	affects	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	influences	drug efficacy
drug efficacy	important for	treatment outcomes
treatment outcomes	assessed by	clinical trials
clinical trials	require	patient participation
patient participation	influenced by	informed consent
informed consent	involves	risk disclosure
risk disclosure	includes	side effects
anti-dementia drugs	interact with	other medications
other medications	may include	antidepressants
antidepressants	used for	depressive symptoms
depressive symptoms	common in	dementia
dementia	may coexist with	Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease	involves	dopamine deficiency
dopamine deficiency	treated with	L-DOPA
L-DOPA	may interact with	anti-dementia drugs
anti-dementia drugs	administered via	oral route
oral route	may affect	bioavailability
bioavailability	determines	drug absorption
drug absorption	affects	plasma concentration
plasma concentration	monitored by	therapeutic drug monitoring
therapeutic drug monitoring	guides	dosage adjustment
dosage adjustment	necessary for	elderly patients
elderly patients	more prone to	adverse effects
adverse effects	may require	drug discontinuation
drug discontinuation	leads to	treatment failure
treatment failure	results in	disease progression
disease progression	measured by	cognitive decline
cognitive decline	assessed by	MMSE
MMSE	evaluates	cognitive function
cognitive function	preserved by	neuroplasticity
neuroplasticity	enhanced by	cognitive training
cognitive training	adjunct to	drug therapy
drug therapy	combined with	non-pharmacological interventions
non-pharmacological interventions	include	physical exercise
physical exercise	improves	cerebral blood flow
cerebral blood flow	reduced in	dementia
dementia	may cause	behavioral symptoms
behavioral symptoms	managed with	antipsychotics
antipsychotics	may worsen	cognitive symptoms
cognitive symptoms	hallmark of	dementia
dementia	affects	caregivers
caregivers	experience	caregiver burden
caregiver burden	measured by	Zarit scale
Zarit scale	evaluates	stress levels
stress levels	impact	immune function
immune function	linked to	neuroinflammation
neuroinflammation	contributes to	neurodegeneration
neurodegeneration	characteristic of	dementia
anti-dementia drugs	target	disease modification
disease modification	aims to	slow progression
slow progression	measured by	clinical scales
clinical scales	track	disease severity
disease severity	predicts	mortality risk
mortality risk	increased in	late-stage dementia
late-stage dementia	requires	palliative care
palliative care	focuses on	quality of life
quality of life	assessed by	QOL-AD
QOL-AD	measures	patient wellbeing
patient wellbeing	influenced by	social support
social support	provided by	family members
family members	may need	counseling
counseling	helps cope with	dementia diagnosis
dementia diagnosis	confirmed by	neuroimaging
