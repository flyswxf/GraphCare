bisphosphonates	class	osteoporosis drugs
kidney stones	composition	calcium oxalate
bone density	measured by	DEXA scan
dietary calcium	source	dairy products
constipation	managed with	fiber supplements
serum calcium	normal range	8.5-10.2 mg/dL
calcium supplements	decreases risk	colorectal cancer
calcium supplements	contraindicated in	sarcoidosis
calcium supplements	alternative form	citrate
calcium supplements	alternative form	carbonate
calcium carbonate	requires	stomach acid
calcium citrate	preferred for	achlorhydria
calcium supplements	maximum dose	2000 mg/day
calcium supplements	timing	with meals
calcium supplements	decreases absorption	iron supplements
calcium supplements	increases risk	cardiovascular events
calcium supplements	prescribed with	vitamin K
vitamin K	role	bone metabolism
bone metabolism	involves	osteoblasts
osteoblasts	function	bone formation
bone formation	marker	osteocalcin
calcium supplements	affects	parathyroid hormone
parathyroid hormone	regulates	calcium homeostasis
calcium homeostasis	involves	kidneys
kidneys	activate	vitamin D
activated vitamin D	name	calcitriol
calcitriol	increases	intestinal calcium absorption
calcium supplements	interaction	thyroid medication
thyroid medication	example	levothyroxine
levothyroxine	absorption decreased by	calcium
calcium supplements	management	spacing doses
calcium supplements	contraindicated with	digoxin
digoxin	risk	cardiac arrhythmia
cardiac arrhythmia	symptom	palpitations
palpitations	evaluation	ECG
ECG	detects	QT interval
hypercalcemia	prolongs	QT interval
QT prolongation	risk	torsades de pointes
calcium supplements	caution in	heart disease
heart disease	example	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	risk factor	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	involves	calcium deposition
calcium deposition	occurs in	arterial walls
arterial walls	contain	smooth muscle
smooth muscle	regulated by	calcium ions
calcium ions	role	muscle contraction
muscle contraction	requires	ATP
ATP	produced in	mitochondria
mitochondria	dysfunction linked to	aging
aging	risk factor	osteoporosis
calcium supplements	benefit	pregnant women
pregnant women	need	fetal development
fetal development	requires	bone mineralization
bone mineralization	component	hydroxyapatite
hydroxyapatite	contains	calcium phosphate
calcium phosphate	ratio	2:1
calcium supplements	avoid with	tetracyclines
tetracyclines	class	antibiotics
antibiotics	side effect	diarrhea
diarrhea	causes	electrolyte imbalance
electrolyte imbalance	includes	hypocalcemia
hypocalcemia	symptom	muscle cramps
muscle cramps	treatment	calcium gluconate
calcium gluconate	administration	intravenous
intravenous	route	emergency use
emergency use	indication	severe hypocalcemia
severe hypocalcemia	complication	seizures
seizures	managed with	benzodiazepines
benzodiazepines	example	lorazepam
lorazepam	side effect	sedation
sedation	risk factor	falls
falls	consequence	hip fractures
hip fractures	mortality rate	20%
mortality rate	reduced by	calcium supplementation
calcium supplementation	compliance issue	pill burden
pill burden	solution	combination products
combination products	example	calcium+vitamin D
calcium+vitamin D	reduces	fracture risk
fracture risk	assessment tool	FRAX
FRAX	considers	age factor
age factor	correlates	bone loss
