antimalarials	is a	drug class
antimalarials	treats	malaria
antimalarials	includes	chloroquine
antimalarials	includes	hydroxychloroquine
antimalarials	includes	mefloquine
antimalarials	includes	quinine
antimalarials	includes	artemisinin
antimalarials	includes	atovaquone
antimalarials	mechanism	inhibits heme polymerization
antimalarials	target	Plasmodium parasite
Plasmodium parasite	causes	malaria
malaria	transmitted by	mosquitoes
mosquitoes	vector for	Plasmodium
chloroquine	resistance in	Plasmodium falciparum
artemisinin	derived from	Artemisia annua
artemisinin	basis for	artemisinin-based combination therapies
artemisinin-based combination therapies	first-line treatment for	malaria
hydroxychloroquine	also treats	rheumatoid arthritis
hydroxychloroquine	also treats	lupus
quinine	historical use	antimalarial
quinine	source	cinchona tree
mefloquine	side effect	neuropsychiatric symptoms
atovaquone	combined with	proguanil
atovaquone-proguanil	sold as	Malarone
Malarone	prevents	malaria
antimalarials	prophylaxis use	travelers
antimalarials	adverse effect	retinopathy
retinopathy	associated with	chloroquine
antimalarials	contraindicated in	G6PD deficiency
G6PD deficiency	causes	hemolysis
hemolysis	side effect of	primaquine
primaquine	treats	Plasmodium vivax
Plasmodium vivax	dormant form	hypnozoite
hypnozoite	reactivation causes	relapse
antimalarials	interact with	cardiac medications
antimalarials	interact with	antacids
antimalarials	interact with	antibiotics
antibiotics	example	doxycycline
doxycycline	also prevents	malaria
doxycycline	side effect	photosensitivity
photosensitivity	risk factor	sunburn
antimalarials	pregnancy category	varies
antimalarials	research focus	vaccine development
malaria vaccine	example	RTS,S
RTS,S	targets	Plasmodium falciparum
Plasmodium falciparum	most deadly	malaria species
malaria	symptom	fever
malaria	symptom	chills
malaria	symptom	anemia
anemia	caused by	hemolysis
antimalarials	pharmacokinetics	liver metabolism
liver metabolism	involves	cytochrome P450
cytochrome P450	affected by	drug interactions
drug interactions	may alter	antimalarial efficacy
antimalarial efficacy	reduced by	resistance
resistance	monitored by	WHO
WHO	recommends	combination therapies
combination therapies	reduce	resistance risk
resistance risk	higher in	monotherapy
monotherapy	example	chloroquine alone
chloroquine alone	ineffective in	resistant regions
resistant regions	include	Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia	endemic for	malaria
malaria	endemic in	tropical areas
tropical areas	climate favors	mosquitoes
mosquitoes	controlled by	insecticides
insecticides	example	DDT
DDT	controversial due	environmental impact
environmental impact	includes	bioaccumulation
bioaccumulation	affects	wildlife
wildlife	example	birds
birds	impacted by	DDT
antimalarials	research area	new drug targets
new drug targets	include	parasite enzymes
parasite enzymes	example	dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase	inhibited by	atovaquone
atovaquone	mechanism	disrupts mitochondrial function
mitochondrial function	essential for	parasite survival
parasite survival	depends on	host nutrients
host nutrients	example	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	digested by	Plasmodium
Plasmodium	life cycle includes	liver stage
liver stage	targeted by	primaquine
primaquine	requires	G6PD testing
G6PD testing	prevents	complications
complications	example	hemolytic crisis
hemolytic crisis	symptom	dark urine
dark urine	indicates	hemoglobinuria
hemoglobinuria	caused by	RBC destruction
RBC destruction	feature of	malaria
malaria	diagnosis	blood smear
blood smear	detects	Plasmodium
Plasmodium	visible under	microscope
microscope	tool for	diagnosis
diagnosis	confirms	infection
infection	severity depends on	parasite load
parasite load	measured by	PCR
PCR	more sensitive than	microscopy
microscopy	cheaper than	PCR
antimalarials	global need	eradication efforts
