rash	may indicate	hypersensitivity
hypersensitivity	requires	discontinuation
discontinuation	leads to	alternative therapy
alternative therapy	includes	febuxostat

hydration	dilutes	urine
urine	excretes	uric acid
antigout preparations	prevent	joint damage
joint damage	results from	chronic gout
chronic gout	requires	long-term treatment
long-term treatment	involves	urate-lowering therapy
urate-lowering therapy	includes	allopurinol

intestines	part of	digestive system
digestive system	affected by	colchicine
colchicine	causes	diarrhea
diarrhea	leads to	dehydration
dehydration	worsens	gout
