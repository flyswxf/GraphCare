rebound congestion	results from	overuse
overuse	requires	medical attention
medical attention	provided by	physicians

corticosteroids	reduce	inflammation
inflammation	part of	immune response
immune response	triggered by	histamine
histamine	blocked by	antihistamines
antihistamines	treat	allergies
allergies	involve	IgE antibodies
IgE antibodies	activate	mast cells
mast cells	release	inflammatory mediators
inflammatory mediators	include	leukotrienes
leukotrienes	targeted by	leukotriene inhibitors
leukotriene inhibitors	example	montelukast
montelukast	prevents	asthma attacks
asthma attacks	involve	bronchoconstriction
bronchoconstriction	relieved by	bronchodilators

albuterol	is	beta-agonist
beta-agonists	relax	smooth muscles
smooth muscles	line	airways
airways	affected by	COPD
COPD	treated with	anticholinergics
anticholinergics	include	ipratropium
ipratropium	blocks	acetylcholine
acetylcholine	transmits	nerve signals
nerve signals	control	gland secretion
gland secretion	produces	saliva
saliva	contains	enzymes
enzymes	break down	food
food	digested in	stomach

neurotransmitters	include	dopamine
dopamine	affects	mood
mood	regulated by	serotonin
serotonin	targeted by	SSRIs
SSRIs	treat	depression
depression	linked to	stress
stress	increases	cortisol
cortisol	suppresses	immunity
immunity	protects against	viruses
viruses	cause	colds
colds	treated with	decongestants
decongestants	interact with	MAOIs
MAOIs	are	antidepressants
antidepressants	affect	norepinephrine
norepinephrine	increases	blood pressure
blood pressure	controlled by	diuretics
diuretics	remove	excess fluid
excess fluid	causes	edema
edema	symptom of	heart failure
heart failure	treated with	beta-blockers
beta-blockers	reduce	heart rate
heart rate	controlled by	pacemaker
pacemaker	uses	electrical impulses
electrical impulses	measured by	ECG
ECG	detects	arrhythmias
arrhythmias	managed with	antiarrhythmics
antiarrhythmics	include	amiodarone
