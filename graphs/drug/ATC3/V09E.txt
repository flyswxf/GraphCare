glucometer	used by	diabetic patients
diabetic patients	prone to	infections
infections	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	bacteria
bacteria	cause	pneumonia
pneumonia	diagnosed with	chest X-ray
chest X-ray	shows	lung infiltrates
lung infiltrates	indicate	inflammation

pain	managed with	analgesics
analgesics	include	opioids
opioids	derived from	poppy plants
poppy plants	source of	morphine
morphine	used for	severe pain
severe pain	experienced in	trauma
trauma	requires	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	performed by	surgeons
surgeons	specialize in	thoracic surgery
thoracic surgery	involves	lung resection
lung resection	removes	tumors
