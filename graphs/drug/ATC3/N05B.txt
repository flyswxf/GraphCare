anxiolytics	includes	buspirone
anxiolytics	includes	barbiturates
benzodiazepines	example	diazepam
benzodiazepines	example	lorazepam
benzodiazepines	mechanism	GABA enhancement
GABA enhancement	causes	sedation
sedation	can lead	dependence
dependence	requires	tapering
tapering	prevents	withdrawal symptoms
withdrawal symptoms	include	seizures

respiratory depression	contraindicates	COPD
COPD	is	lung disease
benzodiazepines	interacts	alcohol
alcohol	potentiates	CNS depression
CNS depression	causes	coma
buspirone	is	non-benzodiazepine
buspirone	acts on	serotonin receptors
serotonin receptors	regulate	mood
mood	affects	depression
depression	comorbidity	anxiety
buspirone	has	delayed onset
delayed onset	limits	acute anxiety
acute anxiety	requires	rapid relief
rapid relief	provided by	benzodiazepines
barbiturates	are	older anxiolytics
barbiturates	have	narrow therapeutic index
narrow therapeutic index	increases	overdose risk
overdose risk	requires	monitoring
monitoring	involves	blood tests
blood tests	measure	drug levels
anxiolytics	prescribed by	psychiatrists
psychiatrists	diagnose	mental disorders
mental disorders	include	GAD
GAD	stands for	generalized anxiety disorder
generalized anxiety disorder	features	excessive worry
excessive worry	impairs	daily functioning

panic attacks	treated with	short-acting anxiolytics
short-acting anxiolytics	example	alprazolam
alprazolam	has	high abuse potential
abuse potential	monitored by	DEA
DEA	regulates	controlled substances
controlled substances	include	Schedule IV drugs
Schedule IV drugs	include	clonazepam
clonazepam	treats	panic disorder
panic disorder	characterized by	recurrent attacks
recurrent attacks	may require	long-term medication
long-term medication	risks	tolerance
tolerance	necessitates	dose escalation
dose escalation	increases	side effects
side effects	include	cognitive impairment

memory	important for	learning
learning	impaired by	anterograde amnesia
anterograde amnesia	caused by	benzodiazepines
benzodiazepines	contraindicated in	elderly
elderly	at risk for	falls
falls	may cause	hip fractures
hip fractures	increase	mortality
mortality	predicted by	frailty
frailty	associated with	polypharmacy
polypharmacy	common in	geriatrics
geriatrics	manages	multiple conditions
multiple conditions	require	drug interactions check
drug interactions check	prevents	adverse events
adverse events	reported to	FDA
FDA	approves	new drugs
new drugs	undergo	clinical trials
clinical trials	test	efficacy
efficacy	measured by	symptom reduction
symptom reduction	evaluated using	HAM-A
HAM-A	is	anxiety rating scale
anxiety rating scale	assesses	severity
severity	determines	treatment choice
treatment choice	considers	patient history
patient history	includes	substance abuse
substance abuse	contraindicates	certain anxiolytics
certain anxiolytics	preferred for	pregnant women
pregnant women	cautioned about	teratogenicity
teratogenicity	risk with	first-trimester use
first-trimester use	affects	fetal development
fetal development	sensitive to	CNS drugs
CNS drugs	cross	placenta
placenta	transfers	nutrients
nutrients	essential for	growth
growth	monitored by	ultrasound
ultrasound	performed by	radiologists
radiologists	use	imaging techniques
imaging techniques	diagnose	abnormalities
abnormalities	may include	neural tube defects
neural tube defects	prevented by	folic acid
