rhinitis	caused by	allergies
rhinitis	caused by	infections
pharyngitis	symptom is	sore throat
pharyngitis	often caused by	viruses
nasal congestion	results from	swollen blood vessels
inflammation	leads to	tissue swelling
allergies	trigger	histamine release
infections	involve	pathogens
viruses	cause	upper respiratory infections
swollen blood vessels	increase	nasal resistance
tissue swelling	causes	discomfort
histamine release	induces	itching
pathogens	include	bacteria
pathogens	include	viruses
upper respiratory infections	affect	sinuses
nasal resistance	leads to	mouth breathing
discomfort	prompts	medication use
itching	triggers	sneezing
bacteria	treated with	antibiotics
viruses	treated with	antivirals
sinuses	connected to	nasal cavity
mouth breathing	causes	dry throat
medication use	requires	proper dosing
sneezing	spreads	droplets
antibiotics	target	bacterial cell walls
antivirals	inhibit	viral replication
nasal cavity	lined with	mucous membrane
dry throat	alleviated by	lozenges
proper dosing	prevents	side effects
droplets	contain	infectious agents
bacterial cell walls	targeted by	penicillin
viral replication	requires	host cells
mucous membrane	produces	mucus

gastrointestinal upset	causes	nausea
diseases	prevented by	vaccines
fungi	produce	antibiotics
particles	removed by	cilia
menthol	provides	cooling sensation
nausea	managed by	antiemetics
vaccines	stimulate	immunity
cilia	line	respiratory tract
cooling sensation	relieves	irritation
antiemetics	block	vomiting center
immunity	involves	antibodies
respiratory tract	includes	bronchi
irritation	leads to	coughing
vomiting center	located in	brainstem
antibodies	produced by	B cells
bronchi	branch into	bronchioles
coughing	clears	airways
brainstem	controls	reflexes
