substance P	transmits	itch signals
antihistamines	interact with	CNS depressants
CNS depressants	enhance	sedative effects
sedation	is	side effect
antihistamines	are contraindicated in	glaucoma
glaucoma	involves	increased intraocular pressure
antihistamines	may worsen	urinary retention
urinary retention	is complication of	BPH
BPH	affects	prostate gland
first-generation antihistamines	cross	blood-brain barrier
blood-brain barrier	protects	CNS
second-generation antihistamines	are less sedating
second-generation antihistamines	include	loratadine
loratadine	is	long-acting
long-acting drugs	require	less frequent dosing
anesthetics	can cause	allergic reactions
allergic reactions	may manifest as	contact dermatitis
contact dermatitis	presents with	skin rash
antipruritics	are used for	eczema
eczema	is characterized by	dry skin
dry skin	predisposes to	itching
antipruritics	help with	insect bites
insect bites	trigger	histamine release
histamine release	causes	local swelling
local swelling	contributes to	pruritus
antipruritics	are applied	topically
topical application	minimizes	systemic effects
systemic effects	include	organ toxicity
organ toxicity	affects	liver function
liver function	impacts	drug metabolism
antipruritics	interact with	MAO inhibitors
MAO inhibitors	are	antidepressants
antidepressants	modulate	neurotransmitter levels
neurotransmitters	regulate	itch sensation
serotonin	influences	itch pathways
itch pathways	involve	spinal cord
spinal cord	transmits	sensory signals
sensory signals	reach	brain
brain	interprets	itch sensation
chronic pruritus	requires	multidisciplinary approach
multidisciplinary approach	includes	dermatologists
dermatologists	specialize in	skin conditions
skin conditions	often cause	itching
itching	leads to	scratching
scratching	causes	skin damage
skin damage	increases	infection risk
infection risk	requires	antibiotics
antibiotics	treat	bacterial infections
bacterial infections	complicate	wound healing
wound healing	is delayed by	scratching
antipruritics	prevent	scratch-itch cycle
scratch-itch cycle	exacerbates	skin lesions
skin lesions	are hallmark of	atopic dermatitis
atopic dermatitis	has genetic predisposition
genetic predisposition	involves	filaggrin mutations
filaggrin mutations	impair	skin barrier
impaired skin barrier	allows	allergen penetration
allergen penetration	triggers	immune response
immune response	releases	pruritogenic cytokines
pruritogenic cytokines	activate	itch neurons
itch neurons	transmit	itch signals
antipruritics	target	pruritogenic mediators
pruritogenic mediators	include	interleukin-31
interleukin-31	is	cytokine
cytokines	regulate	immune responses
immune responses	can become	dysregulated
dysregulated immunity	occurs in	autoimmune diseases
autoimmune diseases	often feature	chronic itching
chronic itching	reduces	quality of life
quality of life	is measured by	questionnaires
questionnaires	assess	symptom severity
symptom severity	guides	treatment selection
treatment selection	considers	comorbidities
comorbidities	influence	drug choice
drug choice	depends on	mechanism of action
mechanism of action	determines	efficacy
efficacy	is evaluated in	clinical trials
clinical trials	establish	safety profiles
safety profiles	inform	prescribing guidelines
prescribing guidelines	recommend	first-line therapies
