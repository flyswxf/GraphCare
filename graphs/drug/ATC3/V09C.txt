DTPA	used in	renal scintigraphy
renal scintigraphy	is a	imaging technique
renal scintigraphy	visualizes	kidney structure
renal scintigraphy	detects	urinary obstruction
urinary obstruction	can cause	hydronephrosis
hydronephrosis	involves	kidney swelling
hydronephrosis	caused by	kidney stones
kidney stones	are	mineral deposits
kidney stones	cause	severe pain
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	helps evaluate	renal transplants
renal transplants	require	donor kidneys
donor kidneys	must match	recipient blood type
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	monitors	post-transplant function
post-transplant function	indicates	graft survival
graft survival	depends on	immunosuppression
immunosuppression	prevents	organ rejection
organ rejection	involves	immune response
immune response	attacks	foreign tissue
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	detects	renal tumors
renal tumors	can be	malignant
malignant tumors	may require	nephrectomy
nephrectomy	is a	kidney removal
nephrectomy	performed for	cancer treatment
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	assesses	renal cortical function
renal cortical function	reflects	nephron health
nephrons	are	kidney functional units
nephrons	filter	blood
blood filtration	produces	urine
urine	contains	waste products
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	evaluates	renal perfusion
renal perfusion	depends on	blood pressure
blood pressure	regulated by	renin-angiotensin system
renin-angiotensin system	affects	sodium balance
sodium balance	influences	fluid retention
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	uses	MAG3
MAG3	is a	radiopharmaceutical compound
MAG3	excreted by	renal tubules
renal tubules	are part of	nephron
MAG3	preferred for	pediatric patients
pediatric patients	have	smaller kidneys
smaller kidneys	require	lower doses
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	involves	fetal development
fetal development	sensitive to	radiation
radiation	can cause	birth defects
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	requires	patient preparation
patient preparation	includes	hydration
hydration	improves	image quality
image quality	affects	diagnostic accuracy
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	compares	kidney function
kidney function	measured by	clearance rates
clearance rates	indicate	filtration efficiency
filtration efficiency	reduced in	chronic kidney disease
chronic kidney disease	leads to	renal failure
renal failure	requires	dialysis
dialysis	replaces	kidney function
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	helps plan	surgical interventions
surgical interventions	aim to	preserve kidney function
preserve kidney function	prevents	dialysis need
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	detects	vesicoureteral reflux
vesicoureteral reflux	involves	urine backflow
urine backflow	causes	urinary infections
urinary infections	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	kill	bacteria
bacteria	cause	inflammation
inflammation	leads to	scarring
scarring	damages	kidney tissue
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	monitors	treatment response
treatment response	evaluated by	imaging changes
imaging changes	reflect	disease progression
disease progression	may require	therapy adjustment
therapy adjustment	involves	dose modification
dose modification	based on	patient weight
patient weight	affects	drug distribution
renal system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	uses	DMSA
DMSA	binds to	renal cortex
renal cortex	contains	glomeruli
glomeruli	filter	plasma
plasma	contains	proteins
proteins	maintain	osmotic pressure
osmotic pressure	regulates	fluid balance
fluid balance	essential for	homeostasis
homeostasis	maintains	body functions
body functions	depend on	kidney health
