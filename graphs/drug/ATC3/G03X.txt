expectations	influence	satisfaction
satisfaction	affects	continuation rates
continuation rates	important for	chronic conditions
chronic conditions	managed with	long-term therapy
long-term therapy	necessitates	follow-up
follow-up	detects	late effects
late effects	include	secondary malignancies
secondary malignancies	screened for	early intervention
early intervention	reduces	mortality
mortality	decreased by	comprehensive care
comprehensive care	coordinates	multiple specialists
multiple specialists	collaborate on	complex cases
complex cases	benefit from	precision medicine
