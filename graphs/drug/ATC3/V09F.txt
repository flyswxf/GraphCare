thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	is a	diagnostic tool
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	used for	thyroid imaging
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	contains	radioactive isotopes
radioactive isotopes	emit	gamma rays
gamma rays	detected by	gamma camera
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	administered via	intravenous injection
intravenous injection	requires	sterile technique
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	evaluates	thyroid function
thyroid function	assessed by	uptake measurement
uptake measurement	indicates	hyperthyroidism
uptake measurement	indicates	hypothyroidism
hyperthyroidism	treated with	antithyroid drugs
hypothyroidism	treated with	levothyroxine
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	includes	technetium-99m
technetium-99m	decays to	technetium-99
technetium-99m	has half-life	6 hours
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	includes	iodine-123
iodine-123	decays to	tellurium-123
iodine-123	has half-life	13 hours
iodine-123	preferred for	thyroid scans
technetium-99m	preferred for	thyroid uptake tests
thyroid scans	visualize	thyroid nodules
thyroid nodules	may be	benign
thyroid nodules	may be	malignant
malignant nodules	require	biopsy
biopsy	confirms	thyroid cancer
thyroid cancer	treated with	surgery
surgery	may involve	thyroidectomy
thyroidectomy	requires	hormone replacement
hormone replacement	uses	levothyroxine
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	alters	thyroid function
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	requires	patient preparation
patient preparation	includes	fasting
patient preparation	includes	avoiding iodine-rich foods
iodine-rich foods	include	seafood
iodine-rich foods	include	dairy products
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	interacts with	thyroid medications
thyroid medications	include	levothyroxine
levothyroxine	suppresses	TSH levels
TSH levels	regulated by	pituitary gland
pituitary gland	secretes	TSH
TSH	stimulates	thyroid hormone production
thyroid hormone production	requires	iodine
iodine	obtained from	diet
iodine deficiency	causes	goiter
goiter	treated with	iodine supplementation
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	used in	Graves disease diagnosis
Graves disease	is a	autoimmune disorder
autoimmune disorder	involves	antibody production
antibody production	targets	TSH receptor
TSH receptor	stimulates	thyroid growth
thyroid growth	leads to	hyperthyroidism
hyperthyroidism	causes	weight loss
weight loss	may result from	increased metabolism
increased metabolism	caused by	excess thyroid hormones
excess thyroid hormones	lead to	tachycardia
tachycardia	treated with	beta blockers
beta blockers	reduce	heart rate
heart rate	monitored by	ECG
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	used in	thyroiditis evaluation
thyroiditis	is a	thyroid inflammation
thyroid inflammation	causes	thyroid pain
thyroid pain	treated with	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	reduce	inflammation
inflammation	involves	cytokine release
cytokine release	triggers	immune response
immune response	involves	white blood cells
white blood cells	include	lymphocytes
lymphocytes	produce	antibodies
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	requires	radiation safety
radiation safety	involves	shielding
shielding	uses	lead aprons
lead aprons	protect from	gamma rays
gamma rays	pose risk of	radiation exposure
radiation exposure	increases	cancer risk
cancer risk	reduced by	ALARA principle
ALARA principle	stands for	As Low As Reasonably Achievable
thyroid diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	stored in	lead containers
lead containers	prevent	radiation leakage
radiation leakage	hazardous to	healthcare workers
healthcare workers	monitored with	dosimeters
dosimeters	measure	radiation dose
radiation dose	limited by	regulatory guidelines
regulatory guidelines	set by	NRC
NRC	oversees	nuclear medicine
nuclear medicine	includes	PET scans
PET scans	use	positron emitters
positron emitters	include	fluorine-18
fluorine-18	used in	FDG-PET
FDG-PET	detects	cancer metastases
cancer metastases	indicate	advanced disease
advanced disease	requires	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	targets	rapidly dividing cells
rapidly dividing cells	include	cancer cells
cancer cells	characterized by	uncontrolled growth
uncontrolled growth	results from	mutations
mutations	caused by	carcinogens
carcinogens	include	radiation
radiation	used in	cancer treatment
