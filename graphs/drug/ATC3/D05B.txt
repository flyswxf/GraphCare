TNF-alpha	targeted by	biologics
biologics	are a type of	antipsoriatics
antipsoriatics for systemic use	includes	methotrexate
methotrexate	is a	DMARD
DMARD	stands for	disease-modifying antirheumatic drug
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug	also treats	rheumatoid arthritis
rheumatoid arthritis	involves	joint inflammation
joint inflammation	causes	pain
pain	managed by	analgesics
antipsoriatics for systemic use	includes	acitretin
acitretin	is a	retinoid
retinoid	derived from	vitamin A
vitamin A	important for	epithelial growth
epithelial growth	affects	skin turnover
skin turnover	accelerated in	psoriasis
antipsoriatics for systemic use	includes	cyclosporine
cyclosporine	suppresses	T-cells
T-cells	produce	inflammatory cytokines
inflammatory cytokines	contribute to	plaque formation
plaque formation	characteristic of	psoriasis vulgaris
psoriasis vulgaris	most common type	psoriasis
antipsoriatics for systemic use	requires	monitoring
monitoring	includes	liver function tests
liver function tests	detect	hepatotoxicity
hepatotoxicity	potential side effect	methotrexate
methotrexate	requires	folic acid supplementation
folic acid supplementation	reduces	side effects
side effects	include	nausea
nausea	can be treated with	antiemetics
antipsoriatics for systemic use	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	requires	contraception
contraception	especially important with	acitretin
acitretin	has long	half-life
half-life	determines	drug clearance
drug clearance	affected by	renal function
renal function	monitored via	creatinine levels
creatinine levels	indicate	kidney health
antipsoriatics for systemic use	interacts with	alcohol
alcohol	increases	liver toxicity
liver toxicity	risk factor for	cirrhosis
cirrhosis	contraindication for	methotrexate
antipsoriatics for systemic use	alternative to	topical therapy
topical therapy	includes	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	reduce	inflammation
inflammation	mediated by	prostaglandins
prostaglandins	synthesized from	arachidonic acid
arachidonic acid	pathway inhibited by	NSAIDs
antipsoriatics for systemic use	newer option	biologics
biologics	target	IL-17
IL-17	cytokine involved	psoriasis pathogenesis
psoriasis pathogenesis	involves	Th17 cells
Th17 cells	subset of	CD4+ T cells
CD4+ T cells	part of	adaptive immunity
adaptive immunity	develops	memory response
memory response	basis for	vaccines
antipsoriatics for systemic use	includes	apremilast
apremilast	is a	PDE4 inhibitor
PDE4 inhibitor	increases	cAMP levels
cAMP levels	regulate	immune response
immune response	dysregulated in	autoimmune diseases
autoimmune diseases	include	psoriasis
antipsoriatics for systemic use	requires	dose titration
dose titration	prevents	adverse effects
adverse effects	may include	infections
infections	risk increased by	immunosuppression
immunosuppression	mechanism of	cyclosporine
cyclosporine	derived from	fungus
fungus	source of	many antibiotics
antibiotics	can trigger	psoriasis flares
psoriasis flares	managed by	systemic therapy
systemic therapy	alternative to	phototherapy
phototherapy	uses	UV light
UV light	increases	skin cancer risk
skin cancer risk	contraindication for	PUVA
PUVA	is a type of	photochemotherapy
photochemotherapy	combines	psoralens
psoralens	photosensitizing agents	plant-derived
plant-derived compounds	basis for	many drugs
many drugs	metabolized by	cytochrome P450
cytochrome P450	affected by	drug interactions
drug interactions	concern with	systemic therapy
systemic therapy	effectiveness measured by	PASI score
PASI score	evaluates	psoriasis severity
psoriasis severity	associated with	comorbidities
comorbidities	include	cardiovascular disease
cardiovascular disease	risk increased by	chronic inflammation
chronic inflammation	biomarker	CRP
CRP	produced by	liver
liver	metabolizes	systemic drugs
systemic drugs	distribution affected by	plasma proteins
plasma proteins	include	albumin
albumin	binds	many drugs
