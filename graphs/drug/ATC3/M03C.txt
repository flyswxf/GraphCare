muscle relaxants	is a	pharmacological class
directly acting agents	is a	subclass of muscle relaxants
directly acting agents	act on	muscle fibers
directly acting agents	affect	contractile proteins
directly acting agents	inhibit	muscle contraction
dantrolene	is a	directly acting agent
dantrolene	acts on	ryanodine receptors
ryanodine receptors	regulate	calcium release
calcium release	affects	muscle contraction
directly acting agents	used for	spasticity
spasticity	caused by	upper motor neuron lesions
upper motor neuron lesions	occur in	multiple sclerosis
multiple sclerosis	treated with	muscle relaxants
directly acting agents	contraindicated in	liver disease
dantrolene	metabolized in	liver
directly acting agents	may cause	hepatotoxicity
hepatotoxicity	monitored by	liver function tests
directly acting agents	alternative to	centrally acting agents
centrally acting agents	include	baclofen
baclofen	acts on	GABA receptors
GABA receptors	inhibit	neuronal activity
directly acting agents	preferred for	malignant hyperthermia
malignant hyperthermia	caused by	anesthetic drugs
anesthetic drugs	trigger	excessive calcium release
dantrolene	treats	malignant hyperthermia
directly acting agents	work at	neuromuscular junction
neuromuscular junction	contains	acetylcholine receptors
acetylcholine receptors	blocked by	nondepolarizing agents
nondepolarizing agents	are	neuromuscular blockers
directly acting agents	differ from	neuromuscular blockers
directly acting agents	can cause	muscle weakness
muscle weakness	affects	daily activities
daily activities	impacted by	spasticity
directly acting agents	administered via	oral route
oral route	affects	drug absorption
drug absorption	influences	onset of action
directly acting agents	have	slow onset
directly acting agents	require	dose titration
dose titration	prevents	adverse effects
adverse effects	include	fatigue
fatigue	worsens	mobility issues
mobility issues	common in	spinal cord injury
spinal cord injury	treated with	muscle relaxants
directly acting agents	interact with	CNS depressants
CNS depressants	potentiate	sedation
sedation	increases	fall risk
fall risk	monitored in	elderly patients
elderly patients	need	lower doses
lower doses	reduce	toxicity
toxicity	manifests as	confusion
confusion	indicates	CNS effects
CNS effects	assessed by	mental status exam
mental status exam	evaluates	cognitive function
directly acting agents	less effective than	botulinum toxin
botulinum toxin	blocks	acetylcholine release
acetylcholine release	necessary for	muscle activation
muscle activation	inhibited by	directly acting agents
directly acting agents	alternative to	orthopedic surgery
orthopedic surgery	corrects	contractures
contractures	result from	chronic spasticity
chronic spasticity	managed with	physical therapy
physical therapy	complements	pharmacological treatment
pharmacological treatment	includes	muscle relaxants
directly acting agents	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	requires	careful medication use
careful medication use	prevents	fetal harm
fetal harm	possible with	hepatotoxic drugs
hepatotoxic drugs	include	dantrolene
dantrolene	requires	liver monitoring
liver monitoring	involves	regular blood tests
regular blood tests	detect	liver damage
liver damage	reversible with	early detection
early detection	improves	treatment outcomes
treatment outcomes	measured by	symptom reduction
symptom reduction	evaluated through	clinical assessment
clinical assessment	considers	functional improvement
functional improvement	goal of	spasticity management
spasticity management	involves	multimodal approach
multimodal approach	combines	drugs and therapy
drugs and therapy	tailored to	patient needs
patient needs	vary by	underlying condition
underlying condition	determines	treatment choice
treatment choice	influenced by	side effect profile
side effect profile	favorable for	directly acting agents
directly acting agents	preferred for	localized spasticity
localized spasticity	affects	specific muscle groups
specific muscle groups	targeted by	focal treatment
focal treatment	includes	botulinum toxin injections
botulinum toxin injections	alternative to	systemic drugs
systemic drugs	include	directly acting agents
directly acting agents	excreted via	kidneys
kidneys	affected by	renal impairment
renal impairment	requires	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	prevents	drug accumulation
drug accumulation	leads to	toxicity
toxicity	monitored via	serum levels
serum levels	indicate	drug concentration
drug concentration	correlates with	therapeutic effect
therapeutic effect	optimized by	proper dosing
proper dosing	ensures	patient safety
