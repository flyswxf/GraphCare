inflammation and infection detection	is a	medical procedure
inflammation and infection detection	uses	biomarkers
biomarkers	include	C-reactive protein
biomarkers	include	procalcitonin
inflammation and infection detection	performed via	blood test
blood test	measures	white blood cell count
white blood cell count	indicates	immune response
inflammation and infection detection	aids in	diagnosis
diagnosis	guides	treatment plan
treatment plan	may include	antibiotics
antibiotics	treat	bacterial infection
bacterial infection	causes	inflammation
inflammation	may lead	tissue damage
tissue damage	requires	medical intervention
medical intervention	involves	surgery
surgery	risks	complications
complications	include	sepsis
sepsis	requires	intensive care
intensive care	involves	monitoring
monitoring	uses	vital signs
vital signs	include	heart rate
heart rate	reflects	patient condition
patient condition	determines	prognosis
prognosis	influences	recovery time
recovery time	affects	hospital stay
hospital stay	increases	healthcare cost
healthcare cost	impacts	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	dictates	treatment options
treatment options	may include	immunotherapy
immunotherapy	modulates	immune system
immune system	defends against	pathogens
pathogens	cause	infections
infections	detected via	PCR test
PCR test	amplifies	genetic material
genetic material	identifies	pathogen type
pathogen type	determines	antibiotic resistance
antibiotic resistance	complicates	treatment
treatment	may require	alternative drugs
alternative drugs	have	side effects
side effects	monitored via	lab tests
lab tests	assess	liver function
liver function	impacts	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	varies by	patient age
patient age	affects	immune response
immune response	influences	infection severity
infection severity	predicts	mortality risk
mortality risk	assessed via	scoring systems
scoring systems	use	clinical data
clinical data	collected via	electronic records
electronic records	stored in	databases
databases	enable	research
research	improves	diagnostic methods
diagnostic methods	evolve with	technology
technology	includes	AI algorithms
AI algorithms	analyze	medical images
medical images	reveal	inflammation sites
inflammation sites	correlate with	pain
pain	managed via	analgesics
analgesics	prescribed by	physicians
physicians	follow	clinical guidelines
clinical guidelines	based on	evidence
evidence	gathered from	trials
trials	test	new drugs
new drugs	target	specific pathways
specific pathways	regulate	immune cells
immune cells	produce	cytokines
cytokines	mediate	inflammation
inflammation	measured via	imaging
imaging	techniques include	MRI
MRI	detects	soft tissue changes
soft tissue changes	indicate	disease progression
disease progression	tracked via	follow-ups
follow-ups	schedule	appointments
appointments	require	patient compliance
patient compliance	affects	outcomes
outcomes	evaluated via	metrics
metrics	include	readmission rates
readmission rates	reflect	care quality
care quality	depends on	hospital resources
hospital resources	include	staff
staff	trained in	protocols
protocols	standardize	procedures
procedures	minimize	errors
errors	lead to	malpractice claims
malpractice claims	increase	legal costs
legal costs	impact	hospital budget
hospital budget	allocates	equipment
equipment	such as	ultrasound machines
ultrasound machines	assist in	abscess detection
abscess detection	requires	drainage
drainage	performed by	surgeons
surgeons	consult	radiologists
radiologists	interpret	scans
scans	show	infection spread
infection spread	determines	antibiotic choice
antibiotic choice	considers	allergies
allergies	documented in	patient history
patient history	reviewed by	nurses
nurses	administer	medications
medications	dispensed by	pharmacies
pharmacies	regulated by	health authorities
health authorities	approve	new tests
new tests	reduce	detection time
detection time	critical for	sepsis management
