antiinfectives and antiseptics	is a	medical class
antiinfectives and antiseptics	treats	infections
antiinfectives and antiseptics	prevents	microbial growth
infections	caused by	microorganisms
microorganisms	include	bacteria
microorganisms	include	viruses
microorganisms	include	fungi
antiinfectives and antiseptics	excludes	corticosteroids
corticosteroids	are	anti-inflammatory agents
antiinfectives	differ from	antiseptics
antiseptics	applied to	skin
antiseptics	used for	wound care
wound care	prevents	infection
antiinfectives	include	antibiotics
antibiotics	target	bacteria
antibiotics	ineffective against	viruses
antiinfectives	include	antivirals
antivirals	target	viruses
antivirals	ineffective against	bacteria
antiinfectives	include	antifungals
antifungals	target	fungi
fungi	cause	fungal infections
bacteria	cause	bacterial infections
viruses	cause	viral infections
antiinfectives	administered via	oral route
antiinfectives	administered via	intravenous route
antiinfectives	administered via	topical route
topical route	used for	skin infections
oral route	convenient for	outpatient treatment
intravenous route	used for	severe infections
severe infections	require	hospitalization
antiinfectives	have	side effects
side effects	include	gastrointestinal upset
gastrointestinal upset	causes	nausea
side effects	include	allergic reactions
allergic reactions	may cause	rash
allergic reactions	may cause	anaphylaxis
anaphylaxis	is a	medical emergency
antiinfectives	interact with	other drugs
drug interactions	affect	efficacy
drug interactions	increase	toxicity
antiinfectives	require	proper dosing
improper dosing	leads to	resistance
resistance	reduces	treatment options
resistance	caused by	overuse
overuse	occurs in	inappropriate prescriptions
antiinfectives	monitored via	lab tests
lab tests	measure	drug levels
lab tests	assess	kidney function
kidney function	affects	drug clearance
liver function	affects	drug metabolism
antiinfectives	contraindicated in	pregnancy
pregnancy	requires	special precautions
special precautions	include	risk assessment
risk assessment	considers	benefit-harm ratio
benefit-harm ratio	guides	treatment decisions
antiinfectives	used in	prophylaxis
prophylaxis	prevents	surgical site infections
surgical site infections	increase	hospital stay
hospital stay	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	affected by	drug choice
drug choice	based on	guidelines
guidelines	recommend	first-line agents
first-line agents	are	cost-effective
cost-effective treatment	reduces	economic burden
economic burden	impacts	healthcare systems
healthcare systems	strive for	efficiency
efficiency	achieved through	evidence-based practice
evidence-based practice	relies on	clinical trials
clinical trials	evaluate	drug safety
drug safety	ensures	patient well-being
patient well-being	is a	treatment goal
treatment goal	includes	symptom relief
symptom relief	improves	quality of life
quality of life	measured by	patient surveys
patient surveys	provide	feedback
feedback	guides	quality improvement
quality improvement	enhances	care delivery
care delivery	involves	multidisciplinary teams
multidisciplinary teams	include	pharmacists
pharmacists	advise on	drug selection
drug selection	considers	local resistance patterns
local resistance patterns	influence	empiric therapy
empiric therapy	initiated before	culture results
culture results	identify	causative organisms
causative organisms	determine	targeted therapy
targeted therapy	is more	effective
effectiveness	measured by	clinical response
clinical response	assessed by	symptom resolution
symptom resolution	indicates	treatment success
treatment success	reduces	complication risks
complication risks	include	sepsis
sepsis	is a	life-threatening condition
life-threatening conditions	require	intensive care
intensive care	provides	advanced support
advanced support	includes	mechanical ventilation
mechanical ventilation	assists	respiratory function
respiratory function	critical for	oxygen delivery
oxygen delivery	essential for	organ perfusion
organ perfusion	maintains	homeostasis
homeostasis	disrupted by	severe infection
severe infection	triggers	systemic inflammation
systemic inflammation	causes	organ dysfunction
organ dysfunction	leads to	multiple organ failure
multiple organ failure	has	high mortality
high mortality	reduced by	early intervention
early intervention	relies on	rapid diagnosis
