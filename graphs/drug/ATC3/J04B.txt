rifampicin	may cause	hepatotoxicity
rifampicin	may cause	orange urine
clofazimine	may cause	skin pigmentation
lepra	leads to	nerve damage
nerve damage	results in	loss of sensation
loss of sensation	increases risk of	injuries
injuries	may lead to	infections
infections	may lead to	amputations
lepra	associated with	social stigma
social stigma	affects	mental health
mental health	impacts	quality of life
quality of life	improves with	early treatment
early treatment	prevents	complications
drug resistance	complicates	lepra treatment
drug resistance	necessitates	alternative drugs
ofloxacin	alternative for	lepra
minocycline	alternative for	lepra
clarithromycin	alternative for	lepra
ofloxacin	inhibits	DNA gyrase
minocycline	inhibits	protein synthesis
clarithromycin	inhibits	protein synthesis
BCG vaccine	may prevent	lepra
BCG vaccine	primarily prevents	tuberculosis
lepra	endemic in	tropical regions
tropical regions	have	limited healthcare
limited healthcare	delays	diagnosis
delayed diagnosis	worsens	prognosis
lepra	diagnosed via	skin biopsy
skin biopsy	detects	acid-fast bacilli
acid-fast bacilli	confirm	lepra diagnosis
lepra	monitored via	clinical examination
clinical examination	assesses	nerve function
nerve function	evaluated via	sensory testing
sensory testing	detects	neuropathy
neuropathy	managed with	physiotherapy
physiotherapy	prevents	contractures
contractures	limit	mobility
mobility	restored with	surgery
surgery	repairs	nerve damage
nerve damage	causes	muscle weakness
muscle weakness	leads to	disability
disability	requires	rehabilitation
rehabilitation	involves	occupational therapy
occupational therapy	improves	daily function
daily function	enhances	independence
independence	boosts	self-esteem
self-esteem	reduces	depression
depression	treated with	antidepressants
antidepressants	include	SSRIs
SSRIs	increase	serotonin levels
serotonin levels	regulate	mood
mood	affects	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	ensures	recovery
recovery	depends on	drug compliance
drug compliance	monitored via	pill counts
pill counts	verify	medication intake
medication intake	prevents	relapse
relapse	indicates	treatment failure
treatment failure	requires	regimen change
regimen change	involves	second-line drugs
second-line drugs	include	fluoroquinolones
fluoroquinolones	target	bacterial DNA
bacterial DNA	mutates	resistance
resistance	necessitates	drug rotation
drug rotation	prevents	resistance development
resistance development	complicates	disease control
disease control	achieved via	public health measures
public health measures	include	contact tracing
contact tracing	identifies	at-risk individuals
at-risk individuals	receive	prophylactic treatment
prophylactic treatment	reduces	transmission
transmission	occurs via	respiratory droplets
respiratory droplets	spread	Mycobacterium leprae
Mycobacterium leprae	has	long incubation
long incubation	delays	symptom onset
symptom onset	prompts	medical consultation
medical consultation	leads to	diagnosis
diagnosis	initiates	treatment plan
treatment plan	tailored to	disease severity
disease severity	classified via	WHO guidelines
WHO guidelines	standardize	lepra management
