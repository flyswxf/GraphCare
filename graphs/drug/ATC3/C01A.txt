cardiac glycosides	used for	atrial fibrillation
cardiac glycosides	contraindicated in	ventricular tachycardia
cardiac glycosides	contraindicated in	AV block
cardiac glycosides	interacts with	diuretics
diuretics	may cause	hypokalemia
hypokalemia	potentiates	cardiac glycosides toxicity
cardiac glycosides	metabolized by	liver
cardiac glycosides	excreted via	kidneys
renal impairment	increases	toxicity risk
cardiac glycosides	narrow	therapeutic index
therapeutic index	requires	serum monitoring
cardiac glycosides	include	digoxin
digoxin	most common	cardiac glycoside
digoxin	has	long half-life
long half-life	necessitates	loading dose
cardiac glycosides	alternatives to	beta-blockers
beta-blockers	also treat	heart failure
cardiac glycosides	symptoms of toxicity	nausea
cardiac glycosides	symptoms of toxicity	vomiting
cardiac glycosides	symptoms of toxicity	visual disturbances
cardiac glycosides	symptoms of toxicity	arrhythmias
arrhythmias	may include	ventricular fibrillation
cardiac glycosides	treatment for toxicity	digoxin immune fab
digoxin immune fab	binds	free digoxin
cardiac glycosides	increases	vagal tone
increased vagal tone	slows	AV conduction
cardiac glycosides	decreases	heart rate
cardiac glycosides	historical use	herbal medicine
foxglove plant	source of	digitalis
cardiac glycosides	affects	action potential
action potential alteration	prolongs	refractory period
cardiac glycosides	reduces	sympathetic activity
cardiac glycosides	increases	cardiac output
increased cardiac output	improves	tissue perfusion
cardiac glycosides	interacts with	amiodarone
amiodarone	increases	digoxin levels
cardiac glycosides	interacts with	quinidine
quinidine	displaces	digoxin
cardiac glycosides	interacts with	calcium
calcium infusion	exacerbates	toxicity
cardiac glycosides	monitoring requires	serum potassium
cardiac glycosides	monitoring requires	serum creatinine
serum creatinine	reflects	renal function
cardiac glycosides	requires	ECG monitoring
ECG monitoring	detects	arrhythmias
cardiac glycosides	causes	ST segment depression
cardiac glycosides	causes	T wave inversion
cardiac glycosides	prolongs	PR interval
prolonged PR interval	indicates	AV block
cardiac glycosides	contraindicated in	Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome	has risk of	rapid conduction
cardiac glycosides	caution in	elderly patients
elderly patients	have reduced	renal clearance
cardiac glycosides	caution in	hypothyroidism
hypothyroidism	reduces	metabolism
cardiac glycosides	caution with	erythromycin
erythromycin	inhibits	P-glycoprotein
P-glycoprotein	affects	drug excretion
cardiac glycosides	caution with	verapamil
verapamil	increases	serum levels
cardiac glycosides	alternative in pregnancy	beta-blockers
cardiac glycosides	classified as	category C
category C	means	potential fetal risk
cardiac glycosides	excreted in	breast milk
breast milk exposure	requires	monitoring
cardiac glycosides	interacts with	St John's wort
St John's wort	decreases	digoxin levels
cardiac glycosides	interacts with	rifampin
rifampin	induces	metabolism
cardiac glycosides	pharmacokinetics	complex
pharmacokinetic complexity	necessitates	individualized dosing
cardiac glycosides	absorption varies by	formulation
liquid formulation	has better	bioavailability
cardiac glycosides	distribution involves	tissue binding
tissue binding	contributes to	long half-life
cardiac glycosides	volume of distribution	large
large volume	indicates	extensive distribution
cardiac glycosides	displacement reactions	significant
displacement reactions	cause	toxicity
cardiac glycosides	enterohepatic recirculation	occurs
enterohepatic recirculation	prolongs	effect
cardiac glycosides	used in	pediatric patients
pediatric dosing	requires	weight-based calculation
cardiac glycosides	alternative administration	IV
IV administration	used for	acute cases
cardiac glycosides	oral bioavailability	60-80%
oral administration	preferred for	chronic therapy
cardiac glycosides	protein binding	25%
low protein binding	means	more free drug
cardiac glycosides	neurohormonal effects	beneficial
neurohormonal modulation	reduces	disease progression
cardiac glycosides	cost-effective	treatment
cost-effectiveness	important for	chronic conditions
cardiac glycosides	remains	valuable therapy
