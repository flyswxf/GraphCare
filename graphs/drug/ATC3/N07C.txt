antivertigo preparations	is a	medication class
antivertigo preparations	treats	vertigo
vertigo	is a	symptom
vertigo	caused by	inner ear disorders
inner ear disorders	include	Ménière's disease
Ménière's disease	causes	hearing loss
antivertigo preparations	includes	betahistine
betahistine	acts as	histamine analog
histamine analog	affects	blood flow
blood flow	influences	inner ear pressure
antivertigo preparations	reduces	nausea
nausea	associated with	motion sickness
motion sickness	related to	vestibular dysfunction
vestibular dysfunction	affects	balance
balance	controlled by	cerebellum
cerebellum	receives input	from inner ear
antivertigo preparations	may cause	drowsiness
drowsiness	increases risk	of falls
falls	lead to	fractures
fractures	require	hospitalization
antivertigo preparations	contraindicated in	pheochromocytoma
pheochromocytoma	is a	tumor
tumor	secretes	catecholamines
catecholamines	elevate	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored during	treatment
antivertigo preparations	interacts with	antihistamines
antihistamines	worsen	sedation
sedation	impairs	driving
driving	requires	alertness
alertness	affected by	CNS depressants
CNS depressants	include	benzodiazepines
benzodiazepines	treat	anxiety
anxiety	exacerbates	vertigo symptoms
antivertigo preparations	alternative to	vestibular rehab
vestibular rehab	improves	compensation
compensation	reduces	dizziness
dizziness	measured by	VNG testing
VNG testing	evaluates	nystagmus
nystagmus	indicates	vestibular asymmetry
vestibular asymmetry	corrected by	surgery
surgery	option for	refractory cases
refractory cases	need	multidisciplinary approach
multidisciplinary approach	involves	neurologist
neurologist	diagnoses	central causes
central causes	include	stroke
stroke	manifests as	acute vertigo
acute vertigo	requires	imaging
imaging	detects	cerebellar infarction
cerebellar infarction	threatens	life
life	preserved by	timely intervention
timely intervention	includes	thrombolytics
thrombolytics	dissolve	clots
clots	cause	ischemia
ischemia	leads to	cell death
cell death	releases	biomarkers
biomarkers	predict	recovery
recovery	assessed by	follow-up
follow-up	ensures	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	prevents	recurrence
recurrence	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	reduced by	prophylaxis
prophylaxis	involves	lifestyle changes
lifestyle changes	include	sodium restriction
sodium restriction	benefits	Ménière's patients
Ménière's patients	experience	tinnitus
tinnitus	managed by	sound therapy
sound therapy	masks	ringing
ringing	disturbs	sleep
sleep	improved by	melatonin
melatonin	regulates	circadian rhythm
circadian rhythm	disrupted in	shift workers
shift workers	prone to	sleep disorders
sleep disorders	aggravate	vertigo
vertigo	relieved by	hydration
hydration	prevents	orthostatic hypotension
orthostatic hypotension	triggers	lightheadedness
lightheadedness	confused with	vertigo
vertigo	differentiated by	Dix-Hallpike test
Dix-Hallpike test	diagnoses	BPPV
BPPV	treated with	Epley maneuver
Epley maneuver	repositions	otoconia
otoconia	displaced in	canalithiasis
canalithiasis	causes	positional vertigo
positional vertigo	resolves	spontaneously
spontaneous resolution	occurs within	weeks
weeks	determine	treatment duration
treatment duration	adjusted for	elderly
elderly	metabolize drugs	slower
slower metabolism	increases	side effects
side effects	monitored by	pharmacist
pharmacist	advises on	dose adjustments
dose adjustments	optimize	efficacy
efficacy	measured by	symptom diaries
symptom diaries	track	frequency
frequency	correlates with	disease severity
disease severity	guides	therapy choice
therapy choice	considers	comorbidities
comorbidities	complicate	management
management	tailored to	patient needs
