combinations of antihypertensives	belong to	ATC group C02
ATC group C02	includes	antihypertensive drugs
combinations of antihypertensives	contain	multiple active ingredients
antihypertensive drugs	treat	hypertension
hypertension	is a	cardiovascular condition
cardiovascular condition	affects	heart
heart	pumps	blood
blood	circulates in	vessels
vessels	include	arteries
arteries	carry	oxygenated blood
oxygenated blood	supplies	organs
hypertension	damages	arteries
damaged arteries	lead to	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	causes	heart disease
heart disease	increases	mortality risk
combinations of antihypertensives	reduce	blood pressure
blood pressure	measured in	mmHg
mmHg	is unit of	pressure
pressure	affects	vessel walls
vessel walls	contain	smooth muscle
smooth muscle	contracts	vessels
contracted vessels	increase	resistance
resistance	affects	blood flow
blood flow	delivers	nutrients
nutrients	include	glucose
glucose	provides	energy
energy	fuels	cells
cells	require	oxygen
oxygen	transported by	hemoglobin
hemoglobin	found in	red blood cells
red blood cells	produced in	bone marrow
bone marrow	affected by	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	treats	cancer
cancer	involves	abnormal cell growth
abnormal cell growth	caused by	mutations
mutations	occur in	DNA
DNA	encodes	proteins
proteins	perform	cellular functions
cellular functions	maintain	homeostasis
homeostasis	regulated by	hormones
hormones	secreted by	endocrine glands
endocrine glands	include	adrenal glands
adrenal glands	produce	aldosterone
aldosterone	regulates	sodium balance
sodium balance	affects	blood volume
blood volume	influences	blood pressure
combinations of antihypertensives	target	RAAS system
RAAS system	regulates	blood pressure
blood pressure	controlled by	baroreceptors
baroreceptors	located in	carotid sinus
carotid sinus	monitors	pressure changes
pressure changes	detected by	nervous system
nervous system	includes	autonomic nerves
autonomic nerves	control	heart rate
heart rate	affects	cardiac output
cardiac output	determines	blood flow
blood flow	delivers	medications
medications	metabolized by	liver
liver	produces	enzymes
enzymes	break down	drugs
drugs	excreted by	kidneys
kidneys	filter	blood
blood	contains	waste products
waste products	removed through	urine
urine	stored in	bladder
bladder	controlled by	sphincters
sphincters	relax during	urination
urination	regulated by	nervous signals
nervous signals	transmitted via	neurons
neurons	communicate via	neurotransmitters
neurotransmitters	include	norepinephrine
norepinephrine	increases	blood pressure
blood pressure	lowered by	beta blockers
beta blockers	block	adrenergic receptors
adrenergic receptors	activated by	adrenaline
adrenaline	secreted during	stress
stress	triggers	fight-or-flight response
fight-or-flight response	increases	heart rate
heart rate	monitored by	ECG
ECG	measures	electrical activity
electrical activity	originates in	SA node
SA node	acts as	pacemaker
pacemaker	regulates	heart rhythm
heart rhythm	can be	irregular
irregular rhythm	called	arrhythmia
arrhythmia	treated with	antiarrhythmics
antiarrhythmics	classified as	Class I-IV drugs
Class I-IV drugs	target	ion channels
ion channels	control	membrane potential
membrane potential	affects	muscle contraction
muscle contraction	powered by	ATP
ATP	generated in	mitochondria
mitochondria	produce	energy
energy	required for	cellular processes
cellular processes	include	protein synthesis
protein synthesis	occurs in	ribosomes
ribosomes	read	mRNA
mRNA	transcribed from	DNA
DNA	packaged in	chromosomes
chromosomes	contain	genetic information
