gonadotropins	is a	ovulation stimulant
ovulation stimulants	include	gonadotropins
gonadotropins	stimulate	ovarian follicles
ovarian follicles	produce	eggs
gonadotropins	mimic	FSH
FSH	regulates	follicular growth
gonadotropins	mimic	LH
LH	triggers	ovulation
ovulation stimulants	treat	infertility
infertility	may cause	anovulation
anovulation	requires	ovulation induction
ovulation induction	uses	gonadotropins
gonadotropins	derived from	urine
gonadotropins	produced as	recombinant
recombinant gonadotropins	have	higher purity
gonadotropins	administered via	injection
injection	requires	medical supervision
gonadotropins	may cause	OHSS
OHSS	is a	complication
complications	require	monitoring
monitoring	involves	ultrasound
ultrasound	assesses	follicular development
gonadotropins	increase	multiple pregnancy risk
multiple pregnancy	carries	higher risks
higher risks	include	preterm birth
gonadotropins	interact with	GnRH analogs
GnRH analogs	control	hormone secretion
hormone secretion	affects	treatment outcome
treatment outcome	measured by	pregnancy rate
pregnancy rate	depends on	patient age
patient age	affects	ovarian reserve
ovarian reserve	determines	response
response	evaluated by	monitoring
gonadotropins	contraindicated in	ovarian cysts
ovarian cysts	may affect	treatment
treatment	requires	baseline assessment
baseline assessment	includes	hormone tests
hormone tests	measure	AMH levels
AMH levels	indicate	ovarian reserve
gonadotropins	used in	IVF
IVF	involves	egg retrieval
egg retrieval	follows	stimulation
stimulation	requires	dosage adjustment
dosage adjustment	based on	response
response	varies by	individual
individual factors	include	BMI
BMI	affects	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	influences	effectiveness
effectiveness	determines	cycle cancellation
cycle cancellation	occurs in	poor responders
poor responders	may need	higher doses
higher doses	increase	side effects
side effects	include	bloating
bloating	results from	ovarian enlargement
ovarian enlargement	monitored by	ultrasound
gonadotropins	stored at	refrigerated temperature
refrigerated temperature	maintains	stability
stability	ensures	potency
potency	affects	treatment success
treatment success	defined as	live birth
live birth	is	ultimate goal
gonadotropins	compared with	clomiphene
clomiphene	is	oral medication
oral medication	has	lower cost
lower cost	increases	accessibility
accessibility	affects	treatment choice
treatment choice	considers	patient preference
patient preference	influenced by	administration route
administration route	impacts	compliance
compliance	affects	outcomes
outcomes	tracked in	registries
registries	provide	safety data
safety data	guides	protocols
protocols	standardize	treatment
standardized treatment	reduces	variability
variability	impacts	success rates
success rates	published in	studies
studies	inform	guidelines
guidelines	recommend	patient selection
patient selection	excludes	contraindications
contraindications	include	hormone-sensitive cancers
hormone-sensitive cancers	may worsen with	stimulation
stimulation	requires	informed consent
informed consent	covers	risks
risks	include	ectopic pregnancy
ectopic pregnancy	is a	complication
complications	managed by	specialists
specialists	follow	treatment algorithms
treatment algorithms	adapt to	patient response
patient response	monitored through	hormone levels
hormone levels	indicate	follicular maturity
follicular maturity	determines	trigger timing
trigger timing	crucial for	oocyte quality
oocyte quality	affects	fertilization
fertilization	leads to	embryo development
embryo development	evaluated by	grading
grading	predicts	implantation potential
implantation potential	influences	pregnancy success
pregnancy success	culminates in	live birth
live birth	validates	treatment efficacy
