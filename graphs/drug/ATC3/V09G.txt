cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	is a	diagnostic tool
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	used for	myocardial perfusion imaging
myocardial perfusion imaging	detects	coronary artery disease
coronary artery disease	causes	heart attack
heart attack	treated with	antiplatelet drugs
antiplatelet drugs	include	aspirin
aspirin	prevents	blood clots
blood clots	can cause	stroke
stroke	diagnosed with	CT scan
CT scan	uses	X-rays
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	contains	radioactive isotopes
radioactive isotopes	include	technetium-99m
technetium-99m	used in	SPECT imaging
SPECT imaging	provides	3D images
3D images	help in	diagnosis
diagnosis	leads to	treatment plan
treatment plan	may include	angioplasty
angioplasty	requires	stent placement
stent placement	prevents	artery blockage
artery blockage	causes	angina
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	measure	blood flow
blood flow	indicates	heart function
heart function	assessed by	ejection fraction
ejection fraction	predicts	heart failure
heart failure	treated with	diuretics
diuretics	reduce	fluid retention
fluid retention	causes	edema
edema	symptom of	kidney disease
kidney disease	affects	drug metabolism
drug metabolism	important for	dosage
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	require	injection
injection	performed by	healthcare professional
healthcare professional	follows	safety protocols
safety protocols	prevent	radiation exposure
radiation exposure	risk factor for	cancer
cancer	treated with	chemotherapy
chemotherapy	side effects include	nausea
nausea	managed with	antiemetics
antiemetics	example is	ondansetron
ondansetron	acts on	serotonin receptors
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	used in	stress tests
stress tests	evaluate	exercise capacity
exercise capacity	indicator of	cardiovascular health
cardiovascular health	improved by	regular exercise
regular exercise	reduces	blood pressure
blood pressure	controlled by	antihypertensives
antihypertensives	include	ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors	examples are	lisinopril
lisinopril	affects	renin-angiotensin system
renin-angiotensin system	regulates	fluid balance
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	detect	ischemia
ischemia	leads to	tissue damage
tissue damage	measured by	biomarkers
biomarkers	include	troponin
troponin	indicates	myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction	requires	emergency care
emergency care	provided in	hospitals
hospitals	have	cardiac units
cardiac units	staffed by	cardiologists
cardiologists	specialize in	heart diseases
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	compete with	echocardiography
echocardiography	uses	ultrasound
ultrasound	safe for	pregnancy
pregnancy	increases	blood volume
blood volume	affects	cardiac output
cardiac output	calculated by	heart rate
heart rate	controlled by	pacemaker
pacemaker	implanted in	surgery
surgery	requires	anesthesia
anesthesia	administered by	anesthesiologist
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	approved by	FDA
FDA	regulates	medical devices
medical devices	include	blood pressure monitors
blood pressure monitors	measure	systolic pressure
systolic pressure	indicates	arterial stiffness
arterial stiffness	associated with	aging
aging	risk factor for	atherosclerosis
atherosclerosis	treated with	statins
statins	lower	cholesterol
cholesterol	produced in	liver
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	research conducted by	scientists
scientists	publish in	medical journals
medical journals	contain	clinical trials
clinical trials	test	new drugs
new drugs	developed by	pharmaceutical companies
pharmaceutical companies	employ	researchers
researchers	study	molecular targets
molecular targets	include	receptors
receptors	bind to	ligands
ligands	can be	drugs
cardiovascular system diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals	stored in	lead containers
lead containers	shield	radiation
radiation	measured in	sieverts
sieverts	quantify	health risk
health risk	assessed by	physicians
physicians	recommend	preventive care
preventive care	includes	vaccinations
vaccinations	prevent	infections
infections	can cause	myocarditis
myocarditis	diagnosed with	MRI
