cortisol	secreted by	adrenal cortex
glycogenolytic hormones	antagonize	insulin
insulin	promotes	glycogenesis
glycogenolysis	occurs in	liver
glycogenolysis	occurs in	muscle
glucose	enters	bloodstream
bloodstream	transports	glucose
glycogenolytic hormones	increase	blood sugar
high blood sugar	leads to	hyperglycemia
hyperglycemia	symptom of	diabetes
diabetes	treated with	insulin
glycogenolytic hormones	activated during	stress
stress	triggers	fight-or-flight response
fight-or-flight response	involves	sympathetic nervous system
sympathetic nervous system	stimulates	adrenal medulla
adrenal medulla	releases	epinephrine
epinephrine	increases	heart rate
epinephrine	dilates	airways
epinephrine	constricts	blood vessels
glucagon	acts on	hepatocytes
hepatocytes	store	glycogen
glycogen	polymer of	glucose
glucagon	binds to	glucagon receptors
glucagon receptors	activate	adenylate cyclase
adenylate cyclase	produces	cAMP
cAMP	activates	protein kinase A
protein kinase A	phosphorylates	glycogen phosphorylase
glycogen phosphorylase	breaks down	glycogen
glycogen phosphorylase	inhibited by	glucose
cortisol	stimulates	gluconeogenesis
gluconeogenesis	produces	glucose
gluconeogenesis	occurs in	liver
cortisol	suppresses	immune system
cortisol	increases	blood pressure
cortisol	reduces	inflammation

sleep	regulated by	circadian rhythm
circadian rhythm	controlled by	suprachiasmatic nucleus
suprachiasmatic nucleus	located in	hypothalamus
glycogenolytic hormones	affected by	fasting
fasting	depletes	glycogen stores
glycogen stores	replenished by	eating
eating	stimulates	insulin secretion
insulin secretion	inhibits	glycogenolysis

fatty acids	used for	energy
fatty acids	oxidized in	mitochondria
glycogenolytic hormones	suppressed by	somatostatin
somatostatin	secreted by	delta cells
delta cells	located in	pancreas
somatostatin	inhibits	glucagon
somatostatin	inhibits	insulin
glycogenolytic hormones	involved in	stress response
stress response	mediated by	HPA axis
HPA axis	includes	hypothalamus
HPA axis	includes	pituitary gland
HPA axis	includes	adrenal glands
adrenal glands	divided into	adrenal cortex
adrenal glands	divided into	adrenal medulla
glycogenolytic hormones	measured in	blood tests
blood tests	require	blood samples
