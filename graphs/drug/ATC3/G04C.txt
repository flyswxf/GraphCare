benign prostatic hypertrophy	treated with	combination therapy
combination therapy	includes	alpha-blockers + 5-alpha reductase inhibitors
combination therapy	more effective	than monotherapy
monotherapy	refers to	single drug treatment
benign prostatic hypertrophy	symptom	nocturia
nocturia	can be managed	with desmopressin
desmopressin	is a	vasopressin analog
desmopressin	reduces	nighttime urination
benign prostatic hypertrophy	complication	acute urinary retention
acute urinary retention	treated with	catheterization
catheterization	can be	temporary or permanent
acute urinary retention	risk factor	older age
older age	increases risk	BPH progression
BPH progression	leads to	surgery
surgery	includes	TURP
TURP	stands for	transurethral resection of prostate
TURP	is a	gold standard surgery
TURP	complications	bleeding
TURP	complications	urinary incontinence
TURP	complications	retrograde ejaculation
benign prostatic hypertrophy	alternative surgery	laser therapy
laser therapy	includes	HoLEP
HoLEP	stands for	holmium laser enucleation of prostate
HoLEP	advantages	less bleeding
HoLEP	advantages	shorter recovery
benign prostatic hypertrophy	alternative surgery	UroLift
UroLift	mechanism	lifts prostate lobes
UroLift	preserves	ejaculatory function
UroLift	disadvantage	not for large prostates
benign prostatic hypertrophy	risk factor	family history
family history	increases likelihood	BPH development
benign prostatic hypertrophy	risk factor	obesity
obesity	linked to	hormonal changes
hormonal changes	involve	estrogen-testosterone ratio
estrogen-testosterone ratio	affects	prostate growth
benign prostatic hypertrophy	risk factor	diabetes
diabetes	associated with	metabolic syndrome
metabolic syndrome	increases inflammation	prostate
inflammation	contributes to	BPH progression
benign prostatic hypertrophy	diagnostic test	PSA
PSA	stands for	prostate-specific antigen
PSA	elevated in	BPH and prostate cancer
prostate cancer	must be ruled out	before BPH treatment
prostate cancer	diagnosed via	biopsy
biopsy	involves	tissue sampling
tissue sampling	analyzed by	pathologist
pathologist	determines	malignancy
malignancy	requires	oncology referral
oncology referral	leads to	treatment planning
treatment planning	may include	radiation therapy
radiation therapy	side effects	urinary irritation
urinary irritation	managed with	symptom control
symptom control	includes	pain medications
pain medications	include	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	examples	ibuprofen
ibuprofen	side effects	gastrointestinal bleeding
gastrointestinal bleeding	risk factor	peptic ulcer disease
peptic ulcer disease	caused by	H. pylori
H. pylori	treated with	antibiotics
antibiotics	include	amoxicillin
amoxicillin	side effects	allergic reactions
allergic reactions	can cause	anaphylaxis
anaphylaxis	treated with	epinephrine
epinephrine	mechanism	vasoconstriction
vasoconstriction	increases	blood pressure
blood pressure	monitored in	hypertensive patients
hypertensive patients	may take	beta-blockers
