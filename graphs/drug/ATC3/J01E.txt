trimethoprim	inhibits	dihydrofolate reductase
dihydrofolate reductase	is	enzyme
enzyme inhibition	leads to	bacterial death
bacterial death	results in	infection clearance
infection clearance	prevents	complications
sulfonamides	treats	urinary tract infections
urinary tract infections	caused by	E. coli
E. coli	is	gram-negative bacteria
gram-negative bacteria	have	cell wall
cell wall	targeted by	antibiotics
trimethoprim	crosses	blood-brain barrier
blood-brain barrier	protects	central nervous system
central nervous system	affected by	meningitis
meningitis	treated with	antibiotics
sulfonamides	causes	allergic reactions
allergic reactions	may cause	rash
rash	is	skin manifestation
skin manifestations	indicate	drug hypersensitivity
drug hypersensitivity	requires	discontinuation
discontinuation	prevents	Stevens-Johnson syndrome
Stevens-Johnson syndrome	is	severe reaction
severe reactions	need	hospitalization
hospitalization	increases	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	affected by	drug choice
drug choice	depends on	bacterial sensitivity
bacterial sensitivity	determined by	culture
culture	identifies	pathogens
pathogens	evolve	resistance
resistance	reduces	drug efficacy
drug efficacy	impacts	treatment duration
treatment duration	affects	patient compliance
patient compliance	influences	outcomes
outcomes	measured by	recovery rate
recovery rate	depends on	early intervention
early intervention	requires	rapid diagnosis
rapid diagnosis	uses	laboratory tests
laboratory tests	detect	infection markers
infection markers	include	white blood cells
white blood cells	fight	infections
infections	classified by	site
site-specific infections	determine	antibiotic selection
antibiotic selection	considers	spectrum
broad-spectrum antibiotics	cover	multiple bacteria
multiple bacteria	cause	polymicrobial infections
polymicrobial infections	need	combination therapy
combination therapy	prevents	resistance development
resistance development	accelerated by	misuse
misuse	includes	incorrect dosing
incorrect dosing	leads to	treatment failure
treatment failure	results in	persistent infection
persistent infection	may require	hospitalization
hospitalization	involves	intravenous antibiotics
intravenous antibiotics	achieve	higher concentrations
higher concentrations	improve	tissue penetration
tissue penetration	affects	drug distribution
drug distribution	determines	therapeutic effect
therapeutic effect	measured by	symptom improvement
symptom improvement	indicates	response
response	evaluated by	clinicians
clinicians	monitor	side effects
side effects	include	gastrointestinal distress
gastrointestinal distress	manifests as	nausea
nausea	may lead to	vomiting
vomiting	affects	drug absorption
drug absorption	influenced by	food
food interactions	modify	bioavailability
bioavailability	determines	dosing regimen
dosing regimen	adjusted for	renal function
renal function	affects	drug excretion
drug excretion	prevents	accumulation
accumulation	causes	toxicity
toxicity	damages	organs
organ damage	requires	dose adjustment
dose adjustment	based on	creatinine clearance
creatinine clearance	reflects	kidney function
kidney function	important for	drug elimination
drug elimination	prevents	adverse effects
adverse effects	reported to	regulatory agencies
regulatory agencies	approve	medications
medications	undergo	clinical trials
clinical trials	assess	safety
safety profile	determines	approval
approval	allows	prescription
prescription	written by	physicians
physicians	consider	patient history
patient history	includes	allergies
allergies	contraindicate	certain drugs
certain drugs	avoided in	pregnancy
pregnancy	requires	special precautions
special precautions	protect	fetus
fetus	vulnerable to	teratogens
teratogens	cause	birth defects
